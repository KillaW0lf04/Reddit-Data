<p>The first "molecules" made from two photons have been created by physicists in the US. Their experiment involves firing pairs of photons through an ultracold atomic gas, where an attractive interaction causes the photons to stick together and become quantum-mechanically entangled. The breakthrough could allow both conventional and quantum computers to encode and process information using photons. </p><p>



Getting photons to stick together is not easy because they normally pass through each other without interacting. However, a photon has an associated electromagnetic field that can modify its surrounding medium. These changes can affect nearby photons and create an effective interaction between them. Although this effect is usually tiny, the interactions can be significant if the medium is chosen carefully. </p>



<h3>Chilled gas</h3>

<p>In the new study, a team led by <a href="http://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/">Mikhael Lukin</a> at Harvard University and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/vuletic_vladan.html">Vladan Vuletic&#769;</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has created strong interactions between photons by sending them through a gas of rubidium atoms chilled to a temperature of just a few degrees above absolute zero. The experiment involved using blue laser light with a carefully chosen wavelength of 479&#160;nm, which modifies the rubidium atoms so that a photon can share some of its energy with several atoms and create a collective "Rydberg state". This state is like a Rydberg atom &#8211; in which an electron is promoted to a very high-energy state &#8211; but instead the electron is shared among several atoms.</p><p>



This Rydberg state propagates through the gas like a sluggish photon with a non-zero mass and when the collective state reaches the opposite edge of the gas cloud, the photon re-emerges at its original energy. When a Rydberg state forms, however, it becomes impossible for more Rydberg states to be created nearby, thanks to a process called the Rydberg blockade. So, when two photons are fired into the gas in quick succession, the first forms a Rydberg state but the second does not. As far as the second photon is concerned, the region of the Rydberg state has a different index of refraction than the rest of the gas, which causes the second photon to stay close to the first as they travel together through the gas. The result is a bound state of two photons &#8211; or a molecule &#8211; travelling through the atomic gas. </p>



<h3>Emerging together</h3>

<p>To monitor this tendency to stay together, the team measured the time interval between the detection of the first and second photons in a pair. Instead of seeing the second photon overtake the slower Rydberg-state photon, the two tend to emerge from the gas together. "It's a photonic interaction that's mediated by the atomic interaction, which makes these two photons behave like a molecule," says Lukin. "So when they exit the medium, they're much more likely to do so together than as single photons." </p><p>



The team was also able to show that the photons in each pair were entangled in terms of their polarization. The researchers did this by firing pairs of photons with a specific polarization into the gas. As the photons travel through the medium, their polarizations change. By measuring the correlation between the polarizations of the photons, the team was able to show that the photons had been entangled when they formed a molecule. </p>



<h3>Photonic molecules</h3>

<p>Creating interactions between photons is not just of intrinsic interest; it could also lead to faster and more energy-efficient computers that use light pulses instead of electrical pulses to process information. Today, such systems are impractical because light pulses must first be converted to electrical pulses for processing and then back again, which is very inefficient. If the light pulses could be made to interact with each other, then all-optical logic gates could be made to process information. </p><p>



Photon molecules could also help in the development of quantum computers, which exploit the principle of entanglement to give two particles much stronger correlations than is allowed by classical physics. While photons are very good at transmitting quantum bits (qubits) of information over long distances, the fact that they do not normally interact with each other makes it difficult to create all-optical logic gates. "What it will be useful for we don't know yet; but it's a new state of matter, so we are hopeful that new applications may emerge as we continue to investigate these photonic molecules' properties," says Lukin.</p><p>

			<h3>Non-linear process</h3>
		
		<blockquote>Interesting way of forming of a molecule of two entangled photons via their dispersive coupling to a cold atomic Rydberg state in gas of cold aoms. However, one often creates quite easily a "molecule" of two entangled photons by splitting a photon in a non-linear crysrtal.</blockquote>

			<h3>Photon-photon interaction</h3>
		
		<blockquote>I think what's important about this is that it's in Nature, and it features a photon-photon interaction. Take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_physics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">two-photon physics</a> on Wikipedia. It concerns gamma-gamma pair production, and it's faithful to the standard model when it says this: <br /><br /><em>“A photon can, within the bounds of the uncertainty principle, fluctuate into a charged fermion-antifermion pair, to either of which the other photon can couple”.</em> <br /><br />But think about it. That’s saying <em>pair production occurs because pair production occurs</em>, spontaneously, like worms from mud. And that a 511keV photon spends its time constantly morphing into a 511keV electron and a 511keV positron, which then magically morph back into a single 511keV photon, which nevertheless manages to keep on going at the speed of light. It just isn’t true. Hopefully this will point the way to completing the standard model by inserting a photon-photon interaction into QED. IMHO that's "within the standard model" work rather than "beyond the standard model" work.</blockquote>

If one divides that field into "chunks," is the individual chunk of field energy then valued at 1/n, meaning to say valued, for example, at 1/5 of the total energy if divided into five "chunks"?</blockquote>I don't know I'm afraid. I don't think so, in that the field energy drops off with distance.<br /><br />I envisage it's something like <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/13/eb82051b7b5ef8f72269256.jpg/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this</a> or <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/266/7c03e14fd2ae99200c7b569.png/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this</a>. The first image depicts a photon, wherein E and B are the spatial and time derivatives of four-potential. Every square that's skewed is a virtual photon. It isn't quite a parallelogram, it's trapezoid, so you have to rotate it 360 degrees before it looks the same, hence spin1. The more skewed it is the more field energy at that location. The second image depicts a gravitational field, wherein Ricci curvature is volume deviation. Every square that's compressed is a (virtual) graviton. You only have to rotate it 180 degrees before it looks the same, hence spin2. The more squashed it is the more field energy at that location. <br /><br />I'm not sure if this is quite right, but it seems reasonable in that the photon is wherever the grid lines are distorted, hence many-paths. And skewed squares are a bit squashed too, so you can treat them as virtual photons <em>and</em> virtual gravitons. For an electron grab the lattice and twist it. Twist the other way for a positron. Hence the leading edge of a photon is a bit like a partial positron. The "messenger particles" aren't real particles flying back and forth - hydrogen atoms don't twinkle and magnets don't shine.</blockquote>

The virtual particles are as real/fictional like the Brownian noise: it has a tangible effect in various scattering phenomena, but it cannot be seen directly just with surface waves (which play a role of light waves in this low-dimensional analogy). The photons correspond the Russel's solitons of transverse waves at the water surface in this model and the neutrinos correspond the so-called Falaco solitons of underwater longitudinal waves.<br /><br />But we should realize, in the above experiment we aren't talking about photons in vacuum - but about bosons inside of boson condensate, so that most of things about photons simply do not apply here. The bosons of massive environment are massive too and they cannot live/propagate outside of it at distance. For example the gluons (i.e. the bosons of atom nuclei environment) tend to condense into glueballs spontaneously, because they do behave like quite massive particles there, due the immense density of atom nuclei. But outside of atom nuclei such a bosons would decompose immediately and they would transform into gamma rays, i.e. normal photons. The same is valid about "photons" inside of boson condensate, once they leave their dense environment.</blockquote>

			<h3>Only two rules ,,,</h3>
		
		<blockquote>To treat the virtual patrticles (and even the paricles, in a way) of whatever type, one has only two basic rules: the Dirac Equation and the Uncertianty Principle.

			<h3>No chunckification of the field</h3>
		
		<blockquote>To calculate any pair of fermion entitites, the basic equation is the Dirac eqution. To find out, if one produces a real pair of particle and anti-particl or vitual ones, it depends upon ratio of the enrgy E in/of the incident field: EM or some other one, and the masses M of the particles produced. If this ratio is = 1 or greater than one, the result is a real pair of particles. However, if this ratio is less than one, one has a pair of vitual particles whose life-period is controlled by the uncertainty principal. For an example, the "charge screening effect", when two electrons (say, in the fine structure constant alpha) interact, is due the vitual excitation of electron and positron pairs caiculated precisley via the QED methods.

			<h3>Conjectures on Photoelectric Effect </h3>
		
		<blockquote>In Photoelectric Effect, Photons arrive at metal plate in vacuum separated by both space and time, Analogy is a light raindrops, landing on pond, each drop is separated from other drop, and strike plate at different times.<br /><br />If two photons are to help each other eject an electron from the metal's surface, they would need to land very close together, and at nearly the same instant, which is not probable even with photon densities created by child using magnifying glass to focus sunlight onto unlucky ant.<br /><br />I believe it is difficult to transport the situation here, with cold atoms working together to share an electron in high energy state, with second photon trapped due to index of refraction effect. <br /><br />However I hope I am incorrect and it may be possible to release the two photons at the same time and same spot on a metal plate to observe photoelectric effect.</blockquote>
