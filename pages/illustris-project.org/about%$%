        <p class="lead">We hope that the Illustris simulation will be of interest to scientists of 
        all disciplines as well as to the broader non-scientific community. Below we describe the 
        'what', 'why', and 'how' of the project at a level accessible to those without any expertise 
        in physics, astronomy, or computer science.</p>
        
        <h3 id="public-one">Motivation & Big Ideas</h3>
        
        <p>The standard model of cosmology posits that the mass-energy density of the Universe is 
        dominated by unknown forms of dark matter and dark energy. Testing this extraordinary scenario 
        requires precise predictions for the formation of structure in the visible matter, which is 
        directly observable as stars, diffuse gas, and accreting black holes. These components of the 
        visible matter are organized in a 'Cosmic Web' of sheets, filaments, and voids, inside which 
        the basic units of cosmic structure - galaxies - are embedded. To test our current ideas on 
        the formation and evolution of galaxies, we strive to create simulated galaxies as detailed 
        and realistic as possible, and compare them to galaxies observed in the real universe. By 
        probing our successes and failures, we can further enhance our understanding of the galaxy 
        formation process, and thereby perhaps realize something fundamental about the world in 
        which we live.</p>

        <p>The Illustris project is a set of large-scale cosmological simulations, including the most 
        ambitious simulation of galaxy formation yet performed. The calculation tracks the expansion 
        of the universe, the gravitational pull of matter onto itself, the motion or "hydrodynamics" 
        of cosmic gas, as well as the formation of stars and black holes. These physical components 
        and processes are all modeled starting from initial conditions resembling the very young 
        universe 300,000 years after the Big Bang and until the present day, spanning over 13.8 
        billion years of cosmic evolution. The simulated volume contains tens of thousands of 
        galaxies captured in high-detail, covering a wide range of masses, rates of star formation, 
        shapes, sizes, and with properties that agree well with the galaxy population observed in the 
        real universe. We are currently working to make detailed comparisons of our simulation box 
        to these observed galaxy populations, and some exciting promising results have 
        already been published.</p>
        
        <h4>What are cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and why are they useful?</h4>
        
        <p>The Lambda Cold Dark Matter (Lambda-CDM) paradigm of cosmology, currently favored by 
        observations of the large-scale distribution of galaxies in space, implies that the cosmos is 
        filled with three distinct components: normal matter (which astronomers term 'baryons'), 
        dark matter, and dark energy. The mathematical models which govern the physical behavior of 
        these components are sufficiently complex that they can only be solved exactly for very 
        particular, simplified "test" problems. Understanding how the nearly uniform, primordial 
        universe evolved into the many diverse phenomena we observe in the night sky today 
        therefore requires the use of computer simulations, which can numerically evolve a 
        representation of some fraction of the universe forward in time.</p>
        
        <p>Simulations of the combined evolution of dark matter and dark energy, which only include 
        the force of gravity, have been run to great success over the past few decades. Recently, such 
        simulations have reached staggering scale, including on the order of 1 trillion particles, 
        each of which exerts a gravitational force on every other. However, such "DM-only" simulations 
        cannot predict the distribution of galaxies made up of normal matter, severely 
        limiting their utility as a means to directly connect with the observations. 
        Our approach for establishing this link is through directly accounting for the baryonic 
        component (gas, stars, supermassive black holes, etc.) in cosmological simulations that 
        calculate fluid motion ("hydrodynamics") as well as gravity, in principle offering 
        a self-consistent and fully predictive methodology. For example, the image below shows two galaxies (out of thousands of similar systems), one on each row, evolving in time from left to right, from when the universe was a quarter its current age, to the present. The top 
        galaxy shows the massive, red, elliptical-shaped galaxy forming after a series of 
        mergers with other systems, whereas the bottom galaxy reveals the formation of a smaller, 
        bluer, disk-shaped galaxy forming after a less violent history of interactions.</p>

        <img class="img-responsive img-cen" src="/static/illustris/images/figure_illustris_2galaxies_evolving.png">
        
        <p> However, the vast computational challenges 
        related to simulations of the baryonic component have thus far precluded wide-spread adoption 
        of this approach. Large-scale predictions of the galaxy population have thus, in the past, 
        mainly been obtained with a different method, whereby galaxies are assigned to live in specific 
        dark matter objects after the simulation has already been completed, and given properties and 
        characteristics based on relatively simple descriptions of the relevant physics. In the 
        Illustris simulation we pursue the computational approach, with a large-scale, cosmological 
        volume, modeling directly the dark and baryonic components of matter.</p>
        
        <h3 id="public-two">Project Description</h3>
                
        <h4>What physics does the simulation include?</h4>
        
        <p>In addition to gravity and hydrodynamics, very complex physical processes such as chemical 
        processes in the diffuse gas, radiation, and magnetic fields also affect cosmic structure 
        formation. Moreover, structure formation is a self-regulating process, in the sense that the 
        structures that form, in particular stars and black holes, affect their surroundings and the 
        subsequent evolution of the next generation of structures. In Illustris, a comprehensive 
        (even if not complete) set of physical processes such as star-formation-driven galactic 
        winds, and black hole thermal energy injection, are modeled throughout cosmic history. 
        These sophisticated models are crucial for achieving a realistic population of modeled 
        galaxies.</p>
        
        <h4>What computational methods does the simulation leverage?</h4>
        
        <p>Over the past few decades, computer simulations of the evolution of the universe, including 
        only the effects of gravity, have reached a point of maturity and accuracy, the 
        <a href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/virgo/millennium/">Millennium simulation</a>
        standing as a prime example. Those which attempt to also include a treatment for gas, such as 
        Illustris, have proven to be significantly 
        harder. A number of fundamentally different methods exist for simulating gas on a computer. 
        In astrophysics, most researchers have used one of two approaches: (i) “smoothed 
        particle hydrodynamics”, or SPH, where the mass of the gaseous fluid is parceled out to a discrete 
        number of particles. These particles move in response to the combined forces of gravity and 
        hydrodynamics, and their position at any time indicates where the gas is, and how it is moving. 
        (ii) The second approach of “Eulerian” or “mesh-based” methods, typically utilizing a scheme 
        called “adaptive mesh refinement” or AMR. In this method, space itself is divided up into a grid, 
        and the flow of gas between neighboring cells of this grid is computed over time.</p>
        
        <p>The Illustris simulation uses a different approach, as implemented in the 
        <a href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~volker/arepo/">AREPO code</a>, which 
        we typically refer to as employing a “moving, unstructured mesh”. Like in AMR, the volume of 
        space is discretized into many individual cells, but as in SPH, these cells move with time, 
        adapting to the flow of gas in their vicinity. As a result, the mesh itself, called a Voronoi 
        tessellation of space, has no preferred directions or grid-like structure. Over the past 
        few years we have shown that this new type of approach for simulating gas has significant 
        advantages over the other two methods, particularly for large, cosmological simulations like 
        Illustris. In addition to being accurate, the AREPO code is also efficient – it can run on 
        tens of thousands of computer cores simultaneously, leveraging some of the largest computers 
        that currently exist for scientific research within the “high performance computing” (HPC) 
        community. The Illustris simulations were run on supercomputers in France, Germany, and the US. 
        The largest was run on 8,192 compute cores, and took 19 million CPU hours (the equivalent of 
        one computer CPU running for 19 million hours, or about 2,000 years).</p>
        
        <h3 id="public-three">What are we learning?</h3>
        
        <p>Before leveraging the output of the simulation to better understand the different types 
        of galaxies that form, and the evolutionary paths they take towards their present day 
        state, we need to ensure that the simulation is a faithful representation of reality. Due 
        to the complexity of the problem, numerical calculations can never fully capture the answer  
        across all scales of space and time. A finite resolution (the size of the smallest details 
        which we can include) means that some processes, such as the birth of individual stars, cannot 
        be directly captured in a cosmological simulation. As a result, we implement many physical 
        approximations, and the burden then arises to ensure that the particular problems of galaxy 
        formation we wish to study are well represented under these approximations. Therefore, we 
        introduce some of the first insights from the Illustris simulation, by first describing this 
        essential comparison against observations:</p>
      
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pdesc">We successfully reproduce a wide range of observable properties 
          of galaxies and the relationships between these properties.</span> Our model is specifically 
          tuned to match two quantities: the present day ratio of the amount of stars to dark matter (DM), 
          for galaxies of all masses, and the total amount of star formation in the universe as a 
          function of time. These two relationships are well constrained by observations, and by 
          construction, we have good agreement with both. Going beyond, we find that the simulation also 
          matches the galaxy stellar mass and luminosity functions (i.e., how many galaxies of each 
          mass and brightness exist), at the present day as well as back in time. The "specific star 
          formation rates" (the rate of new stars being formed in a galaxy, divided by the amount of 
          already-existing stars) also agrees well with observations, not only at the present epoch, 
          but also for all time back to when the universe was thirteen billion years younger than it 
          is today.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">We precisely measure the gas content of the universe, and 
          where it resides.</span> Galaxies in the simulation 
          have the appropriate amounts of neutral hydrogen gas, molecular gas, and "metals" (all 
          elements other than hydrogen and helium), where observations exist. Where data does not 
          yet exist, we can make specific predictions. For instance, we measure that the molecular 
          gas fractions of galaxies increase going back in time until a specific point, when the 
          age of the universe was 2.7 billion years, at which point the increase halts, and 
          its relationship to the amount of stars within the same galaxy becomes significantly 
          stronger. Outside of individual galaxies, Illustris also predicts that at the present 
          time, the majority of gas (~81%) remains in the "intergalactic medium" (the space between 
          galaxies), but that this gas contains only a minority (~34%) of the metals so-far 
          produced in the universe. We encourage you to investigate the relationship between the 
          gas, metals, stars, and dark matter at one instant in time in 
          <a href="/explorer/">The Explorer</a>.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">We investigate the number of "satellite" galaxies, their properties, 
          and their connection to cosmology.</span> Satellite galaxies are those which orbit 
          in the gravitational influence of a much larger, nearby galaxy. Such associates can be 
          relatively small "groups" like our own Local Group, which contains a few 
          dozen galaxies, or larger "clusters", which can contain thousands or tens of thousands of 
          members. We measure the distributions of satellites as a function of distance to their 
          cluster center, for the 10 most massive clusters in our simulation. This profile has a substantially 
          different shape than dark matter only results - more satellites survive in the central 
          region, because the inclusion of stars and gas makes them more resistant to being torn 
          apart by strong tidal forces. We predict that the shape and amplitude of the profile measuring 
          the number of satellites has little evolution further back in time than it has currently 
          been measured. Illustris also demonstrates the process by which environment quenches star 
          formation, i.e. the fact that galaxy star formation 'shuts off' when in the 
          close vicinity of a massive cluster, when compared to an otherwise identical galaxy  
          far from any massive neighbors.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">We study changes in internal structure as galaxy 
          populations evolve in time.</span> 
          A primary measure of galactic structure is the "circular velocity" or "rotation curve", 
          which measures the speed required for a star in a galaxy to maintain a circular orbit 
          (against the pull of gravity) at a given distance from the center. Observationally, 
          the circular velocity profiles of galaxies were found to be nearly constant out to very 
          large distances, indicating that there must also be a significant amount of mass at 
          similarly large distances. As the number of stars drops rapidly, this is one of the key 
          arguments in support of dark matter on the scale of galaxies. In Illustris we generally 
          find such flat, or gradually rising, rotation curves within the distance where gas and stars 
          are a larger contribution to the gravitational pull than DM. We find that the maximum 
          velocity reached is larger when gas and stars are included in the simulation. However, we 
          find that when the universe was about half its current age, the stellar component of galaxies 
          was substantially more concentrated, causing an even larger maximum circular velocity, at 
          even smaller distance from the center. Finally, we also study particular populations from 
          when the age of the universe was a quarter of its current age (coinciding with the peak 
          rate of star formation). Investigating how they grow, we find that galaxies with star formation 
          rates higher than average at this earlier time are substantially more likely to undergo a 
          major merger event (i.e. a collision with another galaxy of similar mass).
          </li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">The impact of gas on the structure of dark matter.</span>
          Some of the largest planned observational campaigns of the near future will attempt to 
          measure the set of "cosmological parameters" at an extremely precise level, by mapping the 
          distribution of galaxies throughout the universe. These parameters constrain the 
          currently accepted "Lambda-CDM" cosmological model, and have implications for e.g. the 
          accelerating expansion of the universe, the age of the universe, the amount of matter 
          in the universe and its division among components such as gas, dark matter, and dark energy. 
          However, expectations for these experiments have so far been generated based on dark matter 
          only simulations. It is already well known that the presence of gas can affect dark matter 
          properties on different scales, for instance causing the centers of dark matter halos to 
          contract to higher densities. We measure the impact of including gas on a function called 
          the "matter power spectrum", and show that the change is up to ~40% when compared to 
          DM-only simulations, and that this change is a complex function of the scale of space you 
          consider. Fully understanding this and related effects of gas on dark matter is an 
          absolute requirement for future cosmological experiments.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">Producing "mock" observations.</span> An important step 
          in bridging the gap between theory and observation is the ability to perform any 
          analysis or comparison in exactly the same manner. For example, in the real universe we 
          observe the light emitted from stars at various wavelengths, but in the simulation we 
          calculate the physical properties of the stars such as mass, age, and chemical 
          composition. Taking these intrinsic properties of a star and calculating how it <i>would</i> 
          look like if observed is a more straightforward process, with less ambiguity, than 
          going in the opposite direction. We create synthetic or "mock" observations of the starlight 
          from galaxies in this manner. First, we re-create one of the most iconic images in 
          astronomy, the Hubble Space Telescope "Ultra Deep Field" (the image below is split in 
          half, to the left and right - one half is real, and one is simulated, can you tell which?), which is 
          the first time a hydrodynamic simulation could construct a faithful deep UDF-like image. 
          To begin to quantify how our galaxies would look as observed with real telescopes, we 
          have also begun to "image" individual objects, which are available to browse in the 
          <a href="/explorer/">Galaxy Observatory</a>. This will allow us to 
          use exactly the same tools as observers, and answer questions such as "which statistic, 
          X or Y, is a more reliable indicator of a galaxy currently undergoing a merger or interaction 
          with another system?"</li>
        </ul>
        
        <img class="img-responsive img-cen" src="/static/illustris/images/figure_illustris_hudf_real_vs_simulated.png">
        
        <p>Many areas of the simulation remain unexplored as researchers associated with the 
        Illustris project continue to investigate interesting and unexpected results. The ultimate 
        goal in each case is a deepening of our understanding of the processes by which the 
        observed population of galaxies formed and evolved over cosmic time. Understanding galaxy 
        formation, however, has broader implications for scales both smaller and larger: galaxies are 
        the sites where individual stars, as well as the planets and the possible tracers of life they 
        harbor, form. At the same time, galaxies are the visible tracers of the large-scale structure 
        of the universe itself, and therefore inexorably linked to the Big Bang, inflation, and the 
        mysterious nature of both dark matter and dark energy.</p>
        
        <p>Moving forward, particular attention to specific discrepancies between simulation and 
        observation will allow us to better understand our galaxy formation model. By addressing 
        these issues, and improving in both physical realism and numerical methods, we can start to 
        think about the next generation of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations after Illustris.</p>

        details of the simulation below.</p>
        
        <h3 id="astronomers-one">Motivation</h3>
        
        <p>Since the advent of modern observational surveys, the sheer volume of available data on the 
        properties of galaxies, their distribution within the large-scale structure of the universe, and 
        their evolution in time has exploded. Surveys including SDSS, 2DF, DEEP2, and CANDELS, and 
        upcoming projects such as LSST, have provided an increasingly precise observational constraint 
        against which any theoretical idea of galaxy formation must be benchmarked. The LCDM cosmology 
        favored by early-universe CMB experiments – particularly WMAP and now PLANCK – provides an 
        extraordinarily precise measurement of the initial conditions for the problem of cosmic structure 
        formation. Numerical calculations are required to probe past the linear regime of early time, 
        and efforts modeling only the gravitational interaction of dark matter and dark energy, neglecting 
        the role of gas and baryonic physics, have led to significant physical insight. Nevertheless, 
        such DM-only simulations do not directly predict anything about the galaxies themselves, requiring 
        an extra step in order to bridge the gap with observations.</p>
        
        <p>Over the past two decades two dominant approaches have been used to establish this link: (1) 
        the technique of ‘semi-analytical modeling’, whereby baryonic physics are modeled at the scale 
        of an entire galaxy, and applied in post-processing on top of DM simulations, and (2) hydrodynamic 
        simulations, whereby the evolution of the gaseous component of the universe is treated using the 
        methods of computational fluid dynamics. The latter approach enables the complex interaction of the 
        different baryonic components (gas, stars, black holes) to be treated at a much smaller scale, 
        ideally yielding a self-consistent and powerfully predictive calculation.</p>
        
        <h4>In the context of previous large simulations</h4>
        
        <div class="row top-buffer-sm">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, due to their high computational cost, have usually 
            targeted specific problems, including the use of ‘zoom-in’ simulations which resolve only one 
            or a few galaxies. They have been harnessed to study the effects of different models or model 
            variations on a particular problem, without explicitly aiming to reproduce the large number 
            of observational constraints available. Only in the past few years have several groups started 
            projects with similar approaches and objectives as the Illustris simulation. These simulations 
            have been steadily improving in three distinct ways: (1) by increasing in size, both in terms 
            of volume and the number of resolution elements employed, (2) by improving the scope, complexity, 
            and physical fidelity of the sub-grid models required to provide a complete and accurate 
            description of the many processes that govern galaxy formation, and (3) by developing more 
            accurate and efficient numerical methods. This trend can be seen in the 
            figure, which shows simulations similar to Illustris (periodic volumes evolved down to z=0) 
            in terms of the number of resolution elements used, as a function of time (Illustris is #19).</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>Nearly tracking Moore’s Law, the growth in simulation size is exponential with a doubling 
        time of approximately 20 months. It is only now, with the available computing power, the 
        sophistication of the numerical approach, and the fidelity of the physical models, 
        that we can simulate a statistically significant volume of the universe down to z=0 with sufficient 
        detail to resolve the internal structure of individual galaxies.</p>
        
        <h3 id="astronomers-two">Key Science Areas</h3>
        
        <p>Below we detail three areas of investigation which have strongly motivated Illustris. 
        However, the project also has the potential to provide important contributions, both in theoretical 
        understanding and in the interpretation of observational data, in a large number of subfields 
        within astrophysics: (1) the low-density IGM, and Lyman-alpha forest, (2) high column density 
        absorbers, LLSs/DLAs, (3) disk galaxies, (4) spheroids, (5) galaxy populations, (6) the CGM, 
        (7) galaxy interactions, (8) galaxy mergers, (9) super massive black holes, (10) starbursts 
        and star-formation modes, (11) AGN and quasars, (12) satellite galaxies, (13) hot halo gas, 
        X-ray, (14) groups and clusters, (15) observed high redshift phenomena, (16) background radiation 
        fields, (17) large scale structure, (18) impact of baryons on dark matter, (19) reionization, 
        and (20) gravitational lensing.</p>
        
        <h4>Structure, kinematics and morphology of galaxies</h4>
        
        <p>A long-standing problem in galaxy formation simulations has been that simulated galaxies are 
        overly compact compared to the observed population, indicating that the angular momentum 
        distribution between the galaxies and their surroundings was incorrect. Our preliminary findings 
        using the AREPO code indicate that the moving-mesh approach may help solve this problem. Early 
        simulations with AREPO yielded galaxies that were more disk-like, more spatially extended, and 
        more rotationally supported than those in otherwise identical simulations performed with the 
        SPH code GADGET-3. However, for the sake of comparison, these simulations did not include 
        feedback processes that are believed to be responsible for removing a large fraction of baryons 
        from galaxies. These were also relatively small periodic volumes, 25 Mpc/h in extent per dimension.</p>
        
        <p>The Illustris simulation volume is 27 times larger, allowing us to obtain a statistical 
        representation of the cosmological galaxy population. By comparing the morphological distribution 
        of this population to locally observed galaxies we can calibrate uncertainties in our modeling 
        of star formation and feedback. We can study the evolution of the gas and metal content of 
        galaxies over time, and compare against the observed galaxy mass-metallicity relation. We can 
        investigate the properties and nature of damped Lyman-alpha absorbers. Unlike in DM-only  
        simulations, we can make a prediction for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate as a function of mass ratio, 
        redshift, and mass. These results are important in understanding the growth of galaxies through 
        mergers, and for calibrating the prescriptions used to quantify merger rates in semi-analytical 
        models. Our previous simulations have already demonstrated that exponential disks are a natural 
        consequence of the hierarchical galaxy assembly process. We can now use Illustris to understand 
        in detail how these profiles arise, by tracing the evolutionary history of the simulated galaxies 
        back to higher redshift, and following the acquisition of angular momentum in the baryon component.</p>
        
        <h4>Gas flows in galactic halos and the physical state of the CGM</h4>
        
        <p>The accretion of gas is one of the main drivers of the internal growth and evolution of galaxies, 
        yet the process by which gas from the IGM interacts with the halo/CGM regime and finally makes it 
        into the galactic ISM remains uncertain. Our numerical method has demonstrated significant advantages 
        in the hydrodynamic treatment, particularly important in this regime. Additionally, the Monte Carlo 
        tracer particle scheme and the inclusion of many such tracers in the main Illustris simulation 
        allow us to reconstruct the time evolution of gas which is accreting into halos and galaxies.</p>
        
        <p>Observations have revealed that galaxies drive high velocity outflows into their surroundings. This 
        material can shock heat, adding hot gas to the halo, while denser parts of the outflows can drive 
        small shocks and possibly survive to large distances. Outflows can compress halo gas, increasing its 
        density and radiative cooling rate, which can cause it to 'rain back' onto the galaxy. Outflows will 
        also interact with cosmological inflow, possibly modulating the nature or rates of this supply of new 
        gas for the central galaxy. We can address the consequences and detectability of both the infalling and 
        outflowing material in galactic halos, and compare to observational signatures of gas in halos and 
        metals in the CGM as probed by methods such as quasar absorption line spectroscopy. By accounting for 
        chemical enrichment processes - and the energetic feedback which redistributes both gas and metals - we 
        can make accurate synthetic observations of the circumgalactic material in the simulations.</p>
        
        <h4>Co-evolution of galaxies and their central black holes</h4>
        
        <p>In the past few decades, a compelling picture has emerged indicating that black holes are common 
        inhabitants of the vast majority of galaxies. The observed scaling relationships between BH masses 
        and their host galaxy properties imply that we need to understand how BHs grow and affect their 
        surroundings. We can explore the evolution of the black hole accretion rate as a function of time, 
        and the link to the host galaxy. Current observational efforts seek to constrain evolution in the 
        scaling relations at z>0, which we can extract directly from the simulations, as well as how the scaling 
        relations depend on e.g. the morphological type of the host galaxy. We can also explore the impact of 
        AGN feedback on the dichotomy between blue and red galaxies, the link to the quenching of star-formation, 
        and how this picture changes with redshift.</p>
        
        <p>It is commonly assumed that active SMBHs at high redshift reside in rare, massive halos embedded in 
        gas-rich, over-dense environments, while recent observational efforts are still working to unambiguously 
        demonstrate that this is the case. Although our simulated volume is not sufficiently large to capture 
        the formation of the brightest quasars at z~6, the volume can be used for determining, and with 
        statistical robustness, the typical environments where less extreme quasars form. Their evolution down 
        to z=0 will allow us to address several open questions. For instance, in analogy to the downsizing of 
        galaxies, it is observed that at high redshifts more massive BHs are powering bright AGN, while at 
        lower redshifts the peak of quasar activity shifts towards smaller mass BHs. With a representative 
        sample of simulated BHs, whose accretion rates are measured directly from the surrounding gas, it 
        will be possible to probe the downsizing of the AGN population as a whole, and why and in which 
        hosts SMBHs enter radiatively inefficient regimes.</p>
        
        <h3 id="astronomers-three">Simulation Details</h3>
        
        <p>We follow the coupled dynamics of DM and gas with the robust, accurate, and efficient 
        quasi-Lagrangian code AREPO. In this approach, an unstructured Voronoi tessellation of the 
        simulation volume allows for dynamic and adaptive spatial discretization, where a set of mesh 
        generating points are moved along with the gas flow. This mesh is used to solve the equations 
        of ideal hydrodynamics using a second order, finite volume, directionally un-split 
        Godunov-type scheme, with an exact Riemann solver. The gravitational force is calculated with 
        a split Tree-PM approach, where long-range forces are calculated from a particle-mesh method, 
        and short-range forces are calculated with a hierarchical octree algorithm. Our galaxy formation 
        model is based on the inclusion of several additional astrophysical processes:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pdesc">Gas cooling and photo-ionization:</span>
          the cooling function is calculated as a function of gas 
          density, temperature, metallicity, UV radiation field, and AGN radiation field. The UV 
          background is a spatially uniform, time dependent field for which reionization completes at z~6.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">Star formation and ISM model:</span>
          our subgrid model for the ISM puts dense gas above 0.13 
          particles per cubic cm on an effective equation of state, assuming a two-phase medium of cold 
          clouds embedded in a tenuous, hot phase. Star formation occurs stochastically following the 
          KS-law and with a Chabrier IMF.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">Stellar evolution:</span>
          stellar populations return mass to the gas phase through stellar winds 
          and supernova. We track and follow the rates associated with SN Ia, SN II, and AGB stars. The 
          evolving abundances of nine elements (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe) are independently considered 
          and advected.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">Stellar feedback:</span>
          we employ a kinetic stellar feedback scheme, which generates a wind 
          with velocity scaled to the local DM dispersion, and mass loading inferred from the 
          available SN energy for energy-driven winds (10<sup>51</sup> erg per SNII). The metal 
          enrichment of winds is modulated such that only 40% of local ISM metals are driven away by 
          these galactic winds.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">Black holes and SMBH feedback:</span>
          we seed new BHs with a mass of 10<sup>5</sup> solar masses 
          in all FoF groups which become more massive than 7x10<sup>10</sup> solar masses. The feedback 
          of SMBHs includes both quasar-mode and radio-mode regimes, and a consideration of the radiation 
          field of AGNs, which heats surrounding halo gas, modifying its ionization state and net cooling rate.</li>

        <p>The initial conditions assume a LCDM cosmology consistent with WMAP-9 measurements, from which 
        a linear power spectrum is used to create a random realization in a periodic box with side 
        length 75 Mpc/h = 106.5 Mpc, at a starting redshift of 127. A series of simulations are run at 
        different resolutions, and a second set is run with only dark matter. The main simulation 
        initially has 1820<sup>3</sup> = 6,028,568,000 hydrodynamic cells, and the same number of DM 
        particles and MC tracers (see table for more details, including mass resolutions and gravitational 
        softening lengths). Evolving the main simulation to z=0 used 8,192 compute cores, a peak memory of 
        25 TB, and 19 million CPU hours.</p>
        
        <h3 id="astronomers-four">Preliminary Results</h3>
        
        <p>For details, please see the three companion papers which present the first key results: 
        Vogelsberger et al. (2014a+b) and Genel et al. (2014), in addition to the many other topics which have 
        been investigated using the Illustris simulation, listed on the 
        <a href="/results/">Results</a> page. 
        We highlight some of the results from those papers below:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><span class="pdesc">Comparison to stellar observables:</span> 
          by construction, our model agrees well with the build-up of stellar mass measured observationally. 
          In particular, the cosmic rate star formation density (SFRD) shows good agreement up to z~10, 
          although we slightly over predict the amount of present day star formation. The z=0 galaxy 
          stellar mass and stellar luminosity functions agree well with SDSS-based measurements over 
          the stellar mass range of 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>12.5</sup> solar masses, and the r-band 
          luminosity range of -15.0 to -24.5 magnitudes. Furthermore, the stellar mass functions and the 
          relation between stellar and halo mass agree well with observations from z=0 to z=7. The baryonic 
          conversion efficiency is most efficient around halo masses of 10<sup>12</sup> solar masses, and 
          drops rapidly for both lower and higher mass systems, due to SN and AGN feedback, respectively. 
          Illustris predicts a maximum efficiency of ~20%, occurring at the Milky Way halo mass scale, 
          in reasonable agreement with abundance matching results. Finally, the evolution of the galaxy 
          specific star formation rates (sSFR) is found to be in good agreement with observations up to z=8.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">Neutral hydrogen, molecular gas and metals in galaxies:</span> 
          Compared to HI observations with ALFALFA, the simulated galaxy population shows the same trend of 
          decreasing HI richness with increasing stellar mass. Contrasting the satellites of our most massive 
          cluster at z=0 to HI measurements of the galaxies in the Virgo cluster, we similarly observe lower 
          HI content than the global population. When considering the molecular gas fraction of galaxies, as 
          a function of stellar mass and redshift, we find good agreement with observations at 0 < z < 3. We 
          measure increasing gas fractions up to z ~ 2.5, before the increase halts and the dependence 
          on redshift flattens, while the mass dependence steepens, a prediction testable by upcoming 
          observations. Finally, we agree well with the observed mass-metallicity relationship over nearly 
          five orders of magnitude in stellar mass, whereby more massive galaxies contain a larger fraction of 
          metals, including the flattening of this relation above 10<sup>11</sup> solar masses.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">Neutral hydrogen characteristics on large scales:</span> 
          we compare the HI column density distribution predicted from Illustris (z=3), as well as the 
          metallicity distribution of DLAs (2 < z < 4), with observations. We find excellent agreement, 
          reproducing in detail the shape and location of the metallicity peak, as well as the shape and 
          normalization of the CDDF. The simulated amount of metals in DLAs, for instance, results from 
          the interplay between gas accretion, outflow, and ionization from the UV background. Probing 
          the large-scale gas distribution at z=0 remains an observational challenge. The Illustris model 
          predicts that the majority of gas (~81%) remains in the IGM at z=0, i.e. is gravitationally 
          unbound from any halo, but that this gas contains only a minority (~34%) of the heavy metals 
          in the universe. </li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">Satellite galaxies:</span> 
          we measure the abundance and spatial distribution of satellite galaxies – in particular, the radial 
          distribution of satellites within our 10 most massive galaxy clusters at z=0.3. This profile 
          is in good agreement with the profile shape and normalization as observed in SDSS groups and 
          clusters at 0.15 < z < 0.4. The profile lies above the DM-only result in the central region, as 
          the stellar component is more resistant to tidal disruption at small radii due to the inclusion 
          of dissipational baryonic physics. In physical units, the evolution of the number density profiles 
          is weak, in agreement with existing observations out to z~1.6, and we predict that this 
          non-evolution further extends to z>3. Studying galaxy colors and red fractions as a function of 
          stellar mass and over-density, we see trends of both mass and environment quenching, in analogy 
          to observations. We also note the environmental independence of the SFR of star forming galaxies, 
          implying that high density environments increase the quenching probability, but do not directly 
          modify the star formation rates of non-quenched systems.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">Evolution of galaxy populations:</span> 
          we follow the evolutionary tracks of galaxies across cosmic time and, as a first application, 
          study two distinct groups. (i) Selecting galaxies at z=2 and investigating their mass growth and merger 
          histories down to z=0, we observe that z=2 galaxies lying above the star-formation main sequence 
          are more likely to undergo a major merger by z=0, than z=2 galaxies on the SFMS. However, the most 
          quenched galaxies at z=2 also have an increasing probability of a future major merger, indicating 
          a relation between extreme star-formation rates and quenching. (ii) In the plane of star formation 
          rate vs. compactness, we find a strong mass segregation in the evolutionary tracks of size 
          evolution and quenching time scale, pointing towards the simultaneous importance of distinct 
          physical processes.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">Galaxy morphologies:</span> 
          we present a quantitative picture of the evolution of morphology from z=0 to z=5 by creating 
          synthetic observations matching the characteristics of the Hubble Extreme Deep Field (XDF). In 
          agreement with observations, simulated galaxies become more irregular and clumpy towards higher 
          redshift, with increasing gas surface densities. The galaxy population in the mock UDF appears 
          strikingly similar to the observed field, in terms of number density, colors, sizes, and morphologies. 
          Visual classification indicates that this single simulation produces both star-forming, blue 
          disk-like galaxies and quenched, red elliptical galaxies. A kinematic bulge-disk decomposition of 
          all systems with stellar mass greater than 10<sup>11</sup> stellar masses indicates that the relative 
          fractions of early-type and late-type galaxies as a function of mass are in good agreement with 
          recent observational samples. Studying intrinsic (g-r) and (u-i) colors, neglecting dust, we find a 
          bimodal color distribution, albeit with an under abundance of red objects when compared to 
          observations.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">Galaxy circular velocity profiles:</span> 
          we find that z=0 galaxies in Illustris have rising or flat rotation curves inside the radius where 
          the baryonic component dominates, and that the peak circular velocity is larger than V<sub>200</sub> 
          of the halo, as a result of baryon-induced contraction. This is in good agreement with observations. 
          At redshifts greater than one, however, we predict that the stellar component is significantly more 
          concentrated, which drives an even larger peak in the circular velocity at smaller radii, around one 
          percent of R<sub>200</sub> of the halo. The gas contribution to the circular velocity is always 
          sub-dominant. Finally, based on a small subset of spiral galaxies, our model reproduces the slope and 
          spread of the observed stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relations reasonably well.</li>
          
          <li><span class="pdesc">How baryons impact DM-only results:</span> 
          we find that the dark matter halo responds to baryonic effects in a non-monotonic and mass dependent 
          manner. The peak induced contraction of halos occurs for galaxy stellar masses of approximately 
          10<sup>11</sup> solar masses at z=0, and for higher stellar masses at higher redshifts. On larger 
          scales, baryonic processes modify the matter power spectrum P(k), particularly relevant on the scales 
          targeted by upcoming weak lensing surveys such as EUCLID, which aim to make a 1% level measurement. 
          We find that on scales smaller than k ~ 0.7/Mpc, AGN-driven outflows reduce the total power by up to 
          40% compared to DM-only simulations, while on even smaller scales (k ~ 70/Mpc) the power is enhanced 
          by a factor of a few. Neither DM-only simulations nor empirical fitting models for the evolution of 
          P(k) accurately describe the result obtained with large volume, hydrodynamic simulations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Future Directions</h4>

        <p>Particular attention to specific discrepancies between the simulation and well-measured observational 
        quantities will allow us to better understand our galaxy formation model. In the course of understanding 
        the preliminary results of the Illustris simulation, we have identified three issues requiring further 
        work: (1) even given the very energetic feedback processes that we employ, additional 
        suppression of galaxy masses is required both in low-mass and high-mass halos. We believe this motivates 
        the development of improved models for sub-grid feedback prescriptions, both stellar and AGN driven. 
        (2) We find that at low redshift, massive halos around 10<sup>13</sup> solar masses are essentially 
        devoid of gas as a result of radio-mode AGN feedback, in disagreement with observations. Given the first 
        point, there then remains no way to match both the stellar and gaseous content of such massive systems 
        by adjusting the energetics of our model alone. We believe a resolution to this issue will require 
        modifications to e.g. the duty cycle or burst-character of the radio-mode, the development of a 
        fundamentally more sophisticated model, and/or the inclusion of presently neglected physics. (3) The 
        stellar ages of low-mass galaxies are incorrect. Although 
        the general trend is captured, galaxies with stellar masses below approximately 10<sup>10.5</sup> 
        solar masses are a factor of 2-3 too old when compared to observations. These systems form their stars 
        too early - the challenge is how to create relatively young stellar populations in these galaxies by 
        delaying the bulk of their star formation until significantly later times.</p>
        
        <p>Although it is possible that additional fine-tuning of model parameters could alleviate some of the 
        tensions listed above, these issues likely point to key assumptions or methods in our models which 
        require revision. They therefore generate a path forward, identifying the areas in which we can push 
        the physical realism and fidelity of our models even further, and hinting at the direction of the 
        next generation of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.</p>
