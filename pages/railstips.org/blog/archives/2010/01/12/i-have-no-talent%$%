      <h1>I Have No&nbsp;Talent</h1> 
    </div>
    <div class="body"> 
      <p>The other day someone sent me an IM and thanked me for my open source contributions. They then said something about <strong>wishing they had my gem/code creation talents</strong>. I didn&#8217;t miss a beat and <strong>informed them that I have no talent</strong>.</p>
<p>It is true. I have no talent. <strong>What I do have is a lot of practice</strong>. And I am not talking about occasionally dabbling in Ruby on the weekends. I am talking about the kind of practice where I beat code that isn&#8217;t working into submission (though often times the code wins).</p>
<p>The kind of practice where all of a sudden I realize that it is 2am and I&#8217;m exhausted physically so I should go to bed, but mentally I feel on fire so I let the code have me for another hour or two (I imagine this state to be like a marathon runner or ironman near the end of their race).</p>
<p>The kind of practice that leads to a <a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker">GitHub profile</a> stuffed with code I regret (and am embarrassed about, but don&#8217;t delete to remind me of where I once was) and code I am proud of (not near as much as I am embarrassed about though).</p>
<h2>Intelligence</h2>
<p>I am also not very smart. I have a good memory (though my wife will tell you it has some missing pieces) and I work really hard. <strong>Really hard</strong>. I get that from my dad. He is also not very smart (his words, not mine), with a good memory and works really hard. :)</p>
<p>I am sick of hearing people say, &#8220;Oh, I love your code, <strong>I wish I could do that</strong>.&#8221; <strong>You can</strong>. The only reason you can&#8217;t <strong>is because you don&#8217;t practice enough</strong>. I used to think that I wasn&#8217;t smart enough. I was jealous of those that did crazy code stuff that I couldn&#8217;t even comprehend. Then, one day, I ran into something I did not understand and instead of giving up, I pushed through. I sat there in front of my computer for hours and wrestled with <a href="http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2006/11/18/class-and-instance-variables-in-ruby/">class and class instance variables</a>.</p>
<p>That day was a turning point for me. It was <strong>the last time</strong> I thought that whether or not I was successful <strong>depended on my talent or intelligence</strong>. It really comes down to hard work people. Ever since then, I have attacked each thing that I do not understand until I understand it.</p>
<p>I will close with this. <strong>I still suck</strong>. There are still so many people out there who are far better than I am, but that does not stop me anymore. I do not measure myself against the programming greats, but against those projects on my Github profile from years ago.</p>

            <p>Great article. I feels like this a lot. I still consider myself pretty wet behind the ears with ruby and rails in general but everyday I learn something new and get a little better.</p>

            <p>I was told by a lot of people that I was &#8220;smart&#8221; growing up.  But that doesn&#8217;t matter, and certainly don&#8217;t tell kids that (it destroys their motivation).  I&#8217;ve spent years finding that thing that drives me to push just a little more.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve clearly laid out here exactly what it takes to be considered &#8220;successful&#8221; by your peers, and you&#8217;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how smart you are, or how talented you are, all you need to do is be willing to work hard and to keep trying until you figure it out.</p>
<p>Its not about &#8220;what you have&#8221;, its about &#8220;what you bring&#8221; and &#8220;how you do it&#8221; that counts!</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this&#8230; I think the community needs it :)</p>

            <p>Well said! I hit the same walls and finally figured out I could get past them just a couple of years ago. Its a great feeling to know you you can tackle anything if you have the drive and patience!</p>
<p>One other note. Sometimes I have to let something go, work on something else, and then come back to it later before a solution presents itself.</p>

            <p><strong>@Jon Hoyt</strong>: Totally. Often times I do this at night. If I run into an issue, I go to bed. In the morning it usually only takes me a few minutes to figure it out. Sleeping on a problem always helps.</p>

            <p>Good post. I can relate completely, but without the &#8220;you&#8217;re so smart&#8221; complements :-)</p>
<p>Back in the beginning of Rails I remember putting off learning how to write a plugin, because I thought that was beyond my knowledge. There&#8217;s nothing different about a plugin, really, except it has init.rb and install.rb. And like your turning point was the class/instance variables, mine was my first Rails plugin.</p>
<p>From that point on I never put off things because I thought it was over my head. I started diving in head first. Also, I started studying. I studied so much code and libraries written by other people until it seemed second-nature. And now, with <a href="http://github.com/rpheath">GitHub</a> it&#8217;s even easier to peruse (and contribute) other people&#8217;s code.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never easy to dive into something completely foreign, but learning is the fun part of the challenge. When a day-long problem finally gets solved, there&#8217;s no better feeling. And before you know it, it&#8217;s no longer a matter of <em>solving</em> the problem, it&#8217;s <em>how</em> to solve the problem.</p>

            <p>Amen. That is so well put.  I hate my hobby code, I rewrite it over and over, and it gets better. I get better through that. But I still think it&#8217;s ugly.</p>

            <p>Pretty good article. I must admit I did wonder a little while ago if I was becoming less intelligent recently though. Anyway, while I think that some people are naturally better at somethings than others your point that you really have to work at things is certainly a much more important factor.</p>
<p>I actually think I personally need to work harder at giving more back though and I think that is where the real &#8216;talent&#8217; lies and often why people praise those who create gems and the like. Taking the time out to actually share what you have done with the rest of the community.</p>

            <p>Great article. I have a theory that &#8220;aptitude&#8221; has more to do with loving something enough to be willing to pound your head against the wall on it until you gain some level of competency. There are some people who are naturally gifted, but those are the exceptions, not the rule. For most of us, the difference between the apprentice and the master is about 10, 000 hours of hard work.</p>

            <p>Absolutely &#8212; practice is much, much more important than anything else. I decided to build a small project to force myself to learn Ruby on Rails early last year and, thanks to some hard work and sheer luck, it was acquired just a few months ago.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now starting on this new side project (<a href="http://www.snailpad.com">http://www.snailpad.com</a>) to force myself to get even better with RoR.</p>
<p>If nothing else, I&#8217;d encourage you to just start coding &#8212; there&#8217;s tons of resources out there that can help you when you get stuck and there&#8217;s nothing better than building something to solve your own problem. :)</p>

            <p>Wait, I&#8217;m pretty sure there is a rails helper for hard work&#8230; :P</p>
<p>I really agree that practice makes it all happen. It also makes for truly enjoyable &#8220;ah-ha&#8221; moments and allows one to take pride in results which are the culmination of hard work.</p>

            <p>I agree wholeheartedly.  It&#8217;s all about effort.</p>
<p>And, as an aside, the missing comma in &#8220;it&#8217;s all about hard work people&#8221; makes it so much better.  Someone should start a Hard Work People club.</p>

            <p>Surprised noone has mentioned Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s &#8220;Outliers&#8221; and his 10,000 hours theory&#8230; basically he argues that to be truly great at anything, you need to put in about 10,000 hours (and have the opportunity to be <strong>able</strong> to put in 10,000 hours, which many people don&#8217;t have.)</p>
<p>Gladwell makes us think that even &#8220;geniuses&#8221; were just people with the right opportunity and lots and lots of dedication&#8230;</p>
<p>(read the book, it&#8217;s good and you can finish it off in a few hours&#8230; if you&#8217;re smart ;-) <strong>cough</strong></p>

            <p>Great Article, I think it comes back to the idea that there are no geniuses. It just comes down to the work you put in.</p>
<p>I feel the same way when people have told me the same. I play piano and work as a programmer. People on occasion are impressed by both, and both are result of hard work and years of practice.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the post, man. I&#8217;m from a different field (development, but no ruby so far) and I never stumbled upon your name &#8216;til today. Anyway &#8211; your GitHub profile is impressive and the post is even better.<br />
If you ever end up in the western part of Germany (I&#8217;m in Cologne) I&#8217;d like to share a beer with you and talk about this kind of mentality.<br />
Thumbs up &#8211; this post made my evening.</p>

            <p>The real issue is to not confuse intelligence with experience.  I had a professor who I idolized while getting my degree in Physics and Mathematics years ago as being the most brilliant person I knew.  I remember trying to solve a problem and sought his help.  He knew I was trying to reduce a hyper-geomtric elliptic integral of the third kind.  I was blown away and asked him how he knew that.  His reply: &#8220;If you had been doing things since before the civil ware, you would know this reduction as well&#8221;.</p>
<p>Likewise in graduate school I had a misguided professor intimate to me that I really wasn&#8217;t that smart because I had the lowest grade in his Atomic Theory class.  The reality was I a 22yo kid with 1 year of Quantum Mechanics.  Compare that to the other 8 students in the class who were all had a MS degree from their respective foreign university and in some cases even taught the course their out of the same book!  Were they smarter than me?  I think not because at the end of the year I scored the highest on the final exam.</p>
<p>So who would you rather have?  The smart guy or the experienced one?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take the experienced, humble one!</p>

            <p>Jon, you&#8217;re absolutely correct.  I&#8217;ve felt this way for many years.  It motivated me to learn rails and objected oriented programming in 4 months.  It wasn&#8217;t until I read &#8220;the outliers&#8221; that I finally found a source that confirmed what I had discovered.</p>
<p>Intelligence is purely hard work as long as you are smart enough, which 90% of us are.</p>

            <p>This really resonated with me, because I often find myself saying some of the same things. It really is about the hard work and the results that come from that hard work.</p>
<p>One of my favorite quotes that i have always used as ammunition to fuel the fire. (it doesn&#8217;t quite match up exactly, but had to share none-the-less)</p>
<p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt (April 23, 1910 // &#8220;The Man In The Arena&#8221; Speech at the Sorbonne Paris, France)</p>

            <p>Intelligence is a talent. But what people don&#8217;t realize is that diligence and the ability to work hard is just as much of a talent. In both cases, they are formed by your genetic makeup and the effect of your environment. There are no other inputs! Not unless you believe in a &#8220;soul&#8221; or &#8220;free will&#8221; or some such  metaphysical phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Phenomenal post.  At the end of the day, showing up and doing the work is where it&#8217;s at.</p>
<p>@Dave Woodward I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with you that telling kids they&#8217;re smart destroys their motivation. While it may lead them to slack off, it doesn&#8217;t have to work that way.  I was told I was smart and given the impression that because I was smart, if I failed, it meant I hadn&#8217;t worked hard enough.  In my case the result was perfectionist workaholic, not slacker.  I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s necessarily a better result, but it&#8217;s certainly a more productive one.  It all depends on how you frame the discussion, and on the particular kid.</p>

            <p>In the book &#8220;Outliers: The Story of Success&#8221;, Malcolm Gladwell calls it the &#8220;10,000-Hour Rule&#8221; of practice.  If you look at the &#8216;great minds&#8217; of the past century &#8211; you&#8217;ll find a great chance of being more than the average joe with timing, circumstances, some smarts, and 10k hours of practice. Even Bill Gates and Bill Joy couldn&#8217;t have been how we know them today without all those hours of practice, learning, tuning, and honing of skills.</p>
<p>If you give any of us a basic set of smarts (which all good programmers have right?) and 10k hours of practice in our field (doesn&#8217;t have to be Ruby), then you&#8217;ll find some &#8216;smart people&#8217; capable of tackling some really &#8216;good problems&#8217; with &#8216;good solutions&#8217;.</p>

            <p>Agree with you. I was decided to do research &amp; development every day in the morning and evening. Day by day, every time I&#8217;m trying to be on the edge and it&#8217;s pretty good adventure and way to success!</p>

            <p>This is promising given Santa brought me the Ruby on Rails book.  I am opting to start with Python as my first dabble into programming (I don&#8217;t think Qbasic back in High School counts).</p>
<p>Elbow grease is usually where it&#8217;s at for any endeavor. Thank you for this. Oh and well Confucius said find a job you love and you will never work a day in your life! Thomas Edison&#8217;s 10,000 experiments getting the light bulb to work says something about practice and intelligence also. Good luck!</p>

            <p>Can&#8217;t gree more, no pain no gain &#8211; and Ruby made the pain fun as well. =) I know loads of people with high IQ that never made it, aka used it for their advantage by excercising. But to learn you have to have interest or inspiration of some sort (say, a open-source hall-of-famer), it&#8217;s a quite fundamental brain rule, brain learns stuff much better that is interesting &#8211; noone can learn anything without attention (that is another brain rule I learned when studyign cognitive psycholoy, even though it&#8217;s quite obvious).

            <p>Talent does not exist and higer IQ statistically proves to be effective only at the beginning of a new activity but not in the long run. <br />
So in fact you are &#8220;talented&#8221; in the only possible way: you are the sum of your worked hours on your passion over the years.</p>
<p>Check out the book &#8220;talent is overrated&#8221;, it has pointers to studies and research confirming the theories.</p>

            <p>John, very nice article! As always! But I think you really have a talent: time management. You drive your own company, you have a family (a wife usually is a time-consuming resource :-) ), you speak in conferences, you maintain at least two excellent blogs with nice regularity&#8230; Maybe you could please us with some time management tips!!!</p>

            <p>This might be true for the author, but I don&#8217;t agree with it as something that is generally true for everyone.  Like it or not, intelligence and talent are necessary for a great many successes in life.  The key is, they aren&#8217;t <strong>sufficient</strong>.  Hard work is also often necessary, and it is very often not sufficient either.</p>
<p>Kudos to the author for finding a field where hard work is often good enough.  Although he probably sells himself short in order to spread some happy thoughts.</p>

            <p>Brilliant article!  I&#8217;ve just come to realize in the last 6 months just how little I know about software development and programming in general.  It&#8217;s reassuring to know that successful coders have gone through the same thing I am currently!</p>

            <p><strong>@failed hope</strong>: I first got into coding in 2004 and started a job in it in 2005. Not that long. I don&#8217;t schedule my practice. It is more inspiration and pure curiosity. I&#8217;m constantly reading both articles and code and anytime I have an itch for something I build it.</p>

            <p>Good article. Thanks. I having same thoughts about few years. I have no talent. And there is persons around me that more talented in programming. I&#8217;ve even considered leaving programming because of that. thinking: &#8220;Maybe there is something, I have talent for&#8221;. But the truth is &#8211; I love what I do, nothing else delivering me such enjoy as programming.</p>

            <p>Great post! I love the idea of only measuring yourself against your own past achievements &#8212; comparing the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">YOU</span></span> of today to the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">YOU</span></span> of yesterday.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to get motivation from those who are &#8220;so much better than us&#8221;, but comparing ourselves to them is not a fair comparison; they took a different path to get to where they are.</p>

            <p>You&#8217;re exactly right. While I suspect I do have some talent backing me up, any substantial achievement IS just plain hard work. That QuickBooks gem wasn&#8217;t made out of clever ideas &#8211; it consists of simply a few <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MONTHS</span></span> of sweat and persistence every day that no one else would buckle down to do. Learning to program? I laugh at the trivial things I wrestled so much with when I practiced for hours when I wasn&#8217;t supposed to on my parents&#8217; computer!</p>

            <p>Wow&#8230; as many comments mention hard work and motivation are really important and can surmount many obstacles. But I find the rest of the comments sickening &#8211; intelligence and an aptitude (aptitudes are often/usually learned/earned) are nothing to be ashamed of. Intelligence is badge that should be worn with pride, not shame. I have no idea what code you&#8217;ve written; but clearly it is compliment-able; accept the compliment &#8212; don&#8217;t make excuses. To all those that think of this as motivational &#8212; shame on yourselves, grow a spine and take give credit to your brain where it is due. Everyone writes shitty code (every now and then) &#8211; the difference is knowing it; hard work and experience give you that.</p>

            <p>Great post and I couldn&#8217;t agree more with it. I&#8217;ve never really thought of myself as a very smart guy even if my friends never agree with that. In fact I think I&#8217;m quite average.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the not giving up and hard work that keeps one going. And once you&#8217;ve solved a hard problem you feel good (and usually want to keep going, even if it&#8217;s already 3am), and you&#8217;ve become that much better. Next time you won&#8217;t even think that long about a similar problem and just do it.</p>
<p>As cliche as it may sound one only needs to give it 110% and it will work out. Eventually.</p>

            <p>Well done that man for being honest and putting it all out there. I too am paranoid about &#8220;being crap&#8221;.</p>
<p>One problem with being as insecure as I am is that other people&#8217;s code really threatens me and I get all anxious &#8220;imagine if they could see mine! It&#8217;s truly dreadful!&#8221;.</p>
<p>None of this matters. As you imply, it doesn&#8217;t matter where you&#8217;re at now, it&#8217;s where you&#8217;re headed that matters. The only thing that&#8217;s important is to be constantly improving. If you&#8217;re better than you were this time last year, you&#8217;re making progress and it&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p>And despite me thinking everything I&#8217;m writing right now being crap, thinking back a year ago I wasn&#8217;t even able to write code. So that&#8217;s a pretty big improvement.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re right &#8211; keeping old code is really encouraging.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for an insightful and very honest post.</p>

            <p>Hello there !<br />
I am a CS student feeling a bit down in the dumps right now. This article is indeed motivating.</p>
<p>However, I do consider myself as hard working but I often have the feeling that the way I am practising is highly inefficient.</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas general tips for a smart approach ?<br />
Let&#8217;s say I have to do an exercise for my programming class. In case I don&#8217;t know how to start, I&#8217;d read the textbook. That might be fine so far but let&#8217;s assume that reading the pages didn&#8217;t help. I am still confused about the exercise. So what now &#8230; reading the text again ? I often do this but this is exactly the point where I thing my approach just sucks. I&#8217;ve probably already memorised what&#8217;s in the book. However, there is a seemingly unbridgeable gap between understanding the concepts and solving the actual problem.</p>

            <p>I totally agree and relate. It&#8217;s all about effort. Being smart is also nice though. The best thing about what you&#8217;re saying too is that its a sneaky way of being boastful. Which is great. If you attribute all of your success to being more hard-working you still get to talk about how much better you are than other people and how much they admire you but you&#8217;re not doing it in a way that conventionally inspires resentment or admonishment. Brilliant.</p>

            <p>I started studying for the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CISSP</span></span> exam but I lost my motivation after looking the amount of material I had to study. After reading this post I think it helped my motivation to come back. If you want to get anything in this life there is always the easy way or the hard way. For most of us the hard way is the only way. This is how I apply your experience to mine. Thank You</p>

            <p>Great inspirational post John. First I&#8217;ve read in a long time that accurately and honestly reflects my life as an entrepreneur and software developer.</p>
<p>Your post reminds me of an oft quoted conversation I had with an older friend nearly 20 years ago. As others derided my friend by attributing his tremendous business success to luck, he replied, &#8220;It&#8217;s true! And the harder I work, the luckier I get.&#8221;</p>

            <p>Agree with what you are saying &#8211; all of life is like this; we could all be healthy &#8211; thou many of us will not appear on the cover of sports mags.  And we could all get involved in government &#8211; except we are beat down by the banks and having to work to produce a living that deters from many people&#8217;s lives &#8211; thou I&#8217;m not concerned because eventually &#8211; with diligent people like yourself working hard and consistently towards better ends and consistent self-improvement, we will achieve the rational age before too long.

            <p>I was pointed to this post by a friend. Really good stuff. I&#8217;m not a programmer, but your outlook here is inspiring enough to make me believe that if I wanted to be, I could. I hope to remember this gem and carry it with me so I can utilize it the next time I feel overwhelmed by something new.</p>

            <p>I wish I had read something like this years ago. I&#8217;ve spent a scant 6 months of my 32 years writing code and I&#8217;m absolutely in love with it. Am I great at it? No, but I know I will be because I enjoy it, so I spend a lot of time doing it. The reason I never started earlier: I didn&#8217;t think I had the &#8220;talent&#8221;. Unfortunately, I believed the prevalent drivel spouted by coders and designers alike that &#8220;not anybody can just DO this web stuff&#8221;. Um, sorry. Yeah. Anybody who works at it can. It&#8217;s nice to see somebody telling it like it is.</p>

            <p>Nice article. Though I have been a developer too, I think this applies quite in general. I have been often told that I can grok math very easily, and ppl wish they had my &#8216;talent&#8217; <del>-</del> the fact of the matter, however is, at some point in my life when I was growing up I had got interested in math, and practiced day in and  day out because I found it interesting. Beyond those teething days I have only kept in touch &#8211; these are my only &#8216;talents&#8217;.</p>

            <p>Hey,<br />
   I am speechless after reading this. I was feeling very low about my career since I have failed in many things at the moment. This post from you has come at the moment when I was totally let down and wanted to give up everything since nothing is working. It has increased my motivation level. Thanks for a wonderful post. I have no talent! But I will work hard to get dirty with what I don&#8217;t understand well! Thank you again. I cannot express it in words.</p>

            <p>I&#8217;ve been told that I&#8217;m smart. That really helped with the frustration when I produced nothing and therefore was a failure. So I was. I am a hard working person but somehow I didn&#8217;t have the habbits, I didn&#8217;t know where to start, didn&#8217;t have who to ask. I needed something like projecteuler.net to start back then but none was available. In a very non-systematic manner did I pass sleep at night over and over until the things started to make sense.</p>
<p>I still can&#8217;t tell that I&#8217;m good at this. But programming really changed my way of thinking. Flushed are &#8220;you&#8217;re smart, you have great potential, I&#8217;m not going to ask because I wouldn&#8217;t look smart, would I?&#8221; and so forth.</p>
<p>I post stupid questions on blogs, answer where I think I can help (humbly if unsure), use netbeans and other tools (I was a do anything in vim for happiness guy), read programming books and seek satisfaction in problem solving, thanks to projecteuler.net.</p>
<p>It is certainly easier now than it was back then if looking from where I am now, but it&#8217;s hard none the less. I didn&#8217;t have a tutor, I try to be one to anybody asking.</p>
<p>And the story would be glamorous if there was only programming. But practice shows you have to be a good programmer, a good accountant, a good marketing person and so much more in order to succeed. Satisfaction is hard to achieve, but is achievable with hard work. Talent is just a stone on the endless pavement</p>

            <p>John, thank you.  Excellent excellent article.  So many of the people who come to me asking for help would be surprised what they could find out on their own if they would just spend 5 minutes in the help file.</p>
<p>I had a similar breakthrough moment, but with a different language.  I took a job on a Lotus Notes support desk and was always baffled by LotusScript.  That is one messed up language.  I dissected countless database and always ended up hitting a wall and banging my head on the desk trying to make sense of it all.  Persistence was the answer.  I just decided to figure it out no matter what it took.  Spent days on end studying examples, trying different things.  Finally it all clicked.  I went on to develop several databases employing LotusScript functions.  I was the &#8216;Notes Guy&#8217; from then on.</p>
<p>Like you say, all the hard work was worth it.  Putting in the time is the only way to get where you want to be, or what you want to know.  It&#8217;s good to hear such sound advice.  This I will subscribe to.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I relate to your testimonial here, as I do believe it&#8217;s the most accurate description of how to achieve proficiency at something.</p>
<p>Another fellow programmer gave his opinion on the matter, and I would like to reproduce one piece of my comment on his post here:</p>
<p>Einstein would be hardly a physics genius without being able to idle at the patent office (a quiet place, you know) thinking about eletromagnets all day and reading Mach and Poincaré with his friends that shared common interests. Similarly, I doubt Picasso would achieve what he did without his father influence, also an artist, motivating him at learning art since the age of 10, ignoring even the traditional education at the time.</p>
<p>The fun fact is that our society tends to ignore that, for each achievement, much frustration and learning had to be overcome. We like to think geniuses were born and then achieved wonders overnight &#8211; ideas still reminiscent from ancient Greek semi-god mythologies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting how cultural the &#8220;myth of talent&#8221; can be, as in oriental cultures, the common sense is quite inverse: that any individual can master anything given enough time, perseverance, and humbleness to learn from his master and understand there&#8217;s always more to improve.</p>

            <p>I completely agree with your thoughts, I too work my ass off. Any spare time I have I play with code, trying to build little sites and figure stuff out. By day Im a front-end developer and by night Im all things considered. I really enjoy coding, and you are only as good as you practice to be. Some people expect to only get that far in their 9-5 jobs and dont ever think about practicing outside of work, but its a necessity that you live and breathe work if you are wishing to be great at it.</p>

            <p>This is certainly an excellent and inspiring post, but I think you do have a few talents, namely perserverence and good time management. Now of course both of those can be &#8220;learned&#8221; in a sense, so maybe they too cannot be called talents. But don&#8217;t belittle your ability to continue on despite obstacles. If great men achieved their greatness not simply from genius, the other big important factor was perserverence.</p>
<p>Not everyone will keep banging their head against the wall until they solve a problem. You will, and I will as well. My problem is not practicing enough and in that sense I do appreciate this post.</p>

            <p>Great thoughts John. I have exactly the same opinion. If you want to be good you must practice. <br />
I really like the part about &#8220;being almost there, tired, but really wanting to solve the problem, even if it&#8217;s dawn&#8221; :)</p>

            <p>I relate to your testimonial here, as I do believe it&#8217;s the most accurate description of how to achieve proficiency at something.</p>
<p>Another fellow programmer gave his opinion on the matter, and I would like to reproduce my comment on his post here:</p>
<p>This discussion about &#8220;Inate Talent&#8221; vs. &#8220;Learning&#8221; is a recurring topic in the field of psychology. There&#8217;s no definitive answer, but some believe that what we call &#8220;talent&#8221; is the result of different influences, both internal and external, acting on the individual. Factors of influence would range from environment pressure, intrapersonal experiences, education, practice, and of course, &#8220;gift&#8221;, be it explained by genetic or some other unknown mechanism, which would develop as talent or not, depending on chance.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe all this developmental theory is bullshit.</p>
<p>If you started training basketball at roughly the same age as M. Jordan, and in the same intensity, I wouldn&#8217;t doubt you could achieve similar results &#8211; in this particular case, considering also that you had favorable genes and health for the practice of the sport, of course.</p>
<p>The main point is: would you be motivated to train, play and learn in the same intensity and quality as M. Jordan? People&#8217;s interest on different activites and topics vary greatly, and I believe this is the main influence behind being &#8220;talented&#8221; or not. Such, I believe there is no thing as &#8220;gift&#8221;, just training and creativity channeled efficiently to one activity, resulting in above-the-mean outcomes.</p>
<p>Einstein would be hardly a physics genius without being able to idle at the patent office (a quiet place, you know) thinking about eletromagnets all day and reading Mach and Poincaré with his friends that shared common interests. Similarly, I doubt Picasso would achieve what he did without his father influence, also an artist, motivating him at learning art since the age of 10, ignoring even the traditional education at the time.</p>
<p>The fun fact is that our society tends to ignore that, for each achievement, much frustration and learning had to be overcome. We like to think geniuses were born and then achieved wonders overnight &#8211; ideas still reminiscent from ancient Greek semi-god mythologies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting how cultural the &#8220;myth of talent&#8221; can be, as in oriental cultures, the common sense is quite inverse: that any individual can master anything given enough time, perseverance, and humbleness to learn from his master and understand there&#8217;s always more to improve.</p>
<p>My hint for you: research about &#8220;multiple intelligence&#8221; theory by Howard Gardner, and also about the &#8220;Tao&#8221; philosophy. Great to expand the mind and not get caught on the &#8220;I&#8217;m more intelligent/talented than others&#8221; mud pit. From the wisest characters in human history, none reasoned like this.</p>

            <p>I had been feeling recently that I was not as good a programmer as I used to be. This article made things clear to me: it is because I have not been practicing. I had become complacent, thinking that I am a &#8220;natural&#8221; at this. Of course, with this attitude, I became duller over time.</p>
<p>Thank you for opening my eyes! Since I read this article about 3 days ago, I am a different person. I am feeling a passion for my art that I hadn&#8217;t felt in years. I am taking a keen interest in becoming an expert in my particular niche of programming. I am &#8220;beating code into submission&#8221;, making good progress in my project, and feeling proud of my work again.</p>

            <p>Nice post John,</p>
<p>you really touched on the most sensitive question all humans ask when they&#8217;re facing an incomprehensible situation:<br />
“maybe we’re just not smart enough? Or I wish I can one day write something as good as this guy did. He’s a genius!”</p>
<p>And I must say this happens a lot when looking at some genius piece of code, when we right away try to imagine the size of the author’s brain.</p>
<p>Just finished reading “Think Smart” by Richard Restak and it is amazing how our brains work!<br />
Brains don’t get <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FULL</span></span> of information, the more you put in the more they want.</p>
<p>By spending those extra hours at 2 AM and sleeping on this new information, you are actually using your brain to its best! <br />
Sleeping on information, as it turns out, actually stores it in the long-term memory how cool is that.</p>
<p>You will be amazed how much practice all known geniuses has put to reach those levels. From Chess players to mathematicians, scientists and so on… Some studies/experiments made, resulted in a person being able to memorize up to 80 digits numbers!!! All with practice!</p>
<p>To better visualize it try to memorize this<br />
98273498273489237423934710234809218340928<br />
340234823048239048204823904829347102348</p>
<p>Which raises the debate are we intelligent by birth! Turns out not!</p>
<p>Thanks John for sharing these personal thoughts!</p>

            <p>I truly believe that we have reached the point where technology has become one with our world, and I am 99% certain that we have passed the point of no return in our relationship with technology.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean this in a bad way, of course! Ethical concerns aside&#8230; I just hope that as technology further innovates, the possibility of transferring our memories onto a digital medium becomes a true reality.

            <p>This is a great article. I have always had a hunch that talent seems a bit too magical, if anything deserves to be labelled talent it should be persistence.<br />
Anyone interested should read &#8220;The Talent Code&#8221; by Daniel Coyle who demistifies the fluff around talent.</p>

            <p>I&#8217;d like to add that it&#8217;s commonly thought that an indicator of &#8220;smart&#8221; is (Joel Spolsky has an article on this) how passionate a person is &#8211; a smart person will tend to be passionate about many things, because this passion (willfulness) allows him to work hard at many different things and find solutions. After all, someone who is not passionate will not work hard, hence not become proffient.</p>

            <p>I would like to compliment you on your candour.<br />
I&#8217;ve been saddled with &#8220;smart&#8221; and &#8220;creative&#8221; as well, the truth is that nine times out of ten it&#8217;s just brute force attacks on a problem. Sometimes it isn&#8217;t even all me, if I really hit a wall I break out the crayons, big paper, beer and marijuana.<br />
It may seem counter productive but write your biggest problem at the top of a huge sheet of paper and give it a try sometime. <br />
Your preferred combination of drugs, alcohol and writing utensils may vary.</p>

            <p>Love it :-) <br />
When I was a kid I used to make ships in bottles and people were always telling me they wished they had my patience. I would get quite annoyed. I have no patience. Just determination. The job gets done because I can&#8217;t let it go till I have cracked it. If anyone had actually seen it happen they would have been able to tell by the tourette&#8217;s attacks that patience was not part of the process :-)</p>

<p>Now they fascinate. Its all a puzzle to be solved. Mice and Monkeys solve puzzles so why can&#8217;t I. I&#8217;m vaguely smarter than some monkeys and I have a computer.</p>
<p>Its all about interest and obsession. You&#8217;re interested in the process and obsessed with understanding. Thats what passion is, really. If you&#8217;re not passionate about something then go find something else!</p>

            <p>great point! thanks for sharing! we definitely have to work hard and keep practicing what we love to do to be good at it. instead of seeing people who are better than you as your competition, consider them as your motivation to work harder and enhance your skills even more.</p>
