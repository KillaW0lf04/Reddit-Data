<h1 class="posttitle">Why Healthcare.gov Sucks? Because They Hired Political Cronies, Not Internet Native Companies To Build It</h1><h3>from the <i>you&#39;re-doing-it-wrong</i> dept</h3><div class="postbody">
There's been plenty of talk lately about just how screwed up the launch of Healthcare.gov has been. While any massively large-scale internet launch is likely to suffer <i>some</i> problems, the level of disaster on this particular project has been quite impressive. This has led some to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/10/09/why-obamas-tech-savvy-team-couldnt-make-obamacare-glitch-free/?hpid=z4" target="_blank">wonder why this happened</a>, especially given the reputation of President Obama's "web-savvy" campaign team. The answers aren't too hard to figure out, of course. First off, the campaign team is quite different from the team implementing this -- which was handled by the Department of Health and Human Services. But, more importantly: it appears that the federal government basically <a href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2013/aca-contractors/" target="_blank">handed this project over to the same crew of giant government contractors</a>, who have a long history of screwed up giant IT projects, and almost no sense of the "internet native" world.
<br/><br/>
The Sunlight Foundation (link above) figured out the list of contractors who worked on the site, and noted that the big ones not only are well-known DC power-player insiders, but they're also big on the lobbying and political contributions side of things. You've got companies like... Booz Allen Hamilton, famous for promoting cyberwar hype and employing Ed Snowden. There's defense contracting giant Northrup Grumman. Then there's SAIC -- which I can't believe can still get government business. This is the same firm that famously was given a $380 million contract to revamp the FBI system, on which it went $220 million over budget, and then saw the <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050113/0954214_F.shtml">entire system scrapped</a> after it (literally) brought some users to tears, and the FBI realized it was useless in fighting terrorism. SAIC is also the company that <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110630/17425614926/mayor-bloomberg-demands-saic-pay-back-600-million-cost-overruns-nyc-computer-system.shtml">NYC Mayor Bloomberg demanded return $600 million</a> after a city computer project (budgeted at $68 million) actually cost $740 million. SAIC has a <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130829/09573024349/oaklands-city-wide-surveillance-network-being-built-contractor-with-history-fraud-little-regard-civil-liberties.shtml">long list</a> of similar spectacular failures on government IT projects.
<br/><br/>
As you look down the list put together by the Sunlight Foundation, it's all companies like this: giant monstrosities which are simply tied in closely with the government. All the large consulting firms are listed: Accenture, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, McKinsey. What's missing? Basically any company with even the slightest smidgen of experience building and maintaining large-scale, public-facing web-based apps. The list has no "internet native" companies.
<br/><br/>
Many, many years ago, I worked for an e-commerce startup here in Silicon Valley, and I ended up (sort of by default) in charge of trying to open up the government market for what we were doing. It involved meeting with a slew of all-too-slick, ex-politician, ex-military "consultants" with no technical knowledge whatsoever, who, for $15k to $25k/month retainers plus a (large) cut of any deal, would drink hard liquor and promise to "connect" us with big companies with government connections, and then help us sneak past the government bidding process to get no-bid contracts. It was an eye-opening experience that highlighted for me that getting government contracts in the tech world was very much about who you knew, rather than any actual knowledge, skills or experience. While this was quite a long time ago, it would appear that little has changed.</div>

<h3 class="commentsubject">Regulatory Capture</h3><div class="cbody">What part of this is outright cronyism vs. regulatory capture? I know plenty of people who could build healthcare.gov quickly, reliably, and cheaply, but I've also seen plenty of government contracts. Those things can be monstrous, and there are plenty of qualified individuals unable to work on healthcare.gov solely because they couldn't (or wouldn't) want to comply with all of the government's rules.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Government Contracts...</h3><div class="cbody">By "basic safety protocols weren't followed" he means oil-soaked rags were piled up and placed under a tarp on top of an asphalt roof on a cloudless, 90-degree day. Next to propane tanks.<br/><br/>Then the company tasked with the cleanup (as he said, same one that blew it up), hired laborers without any background check to come into a "secured" federal facility and haul the computers to storage. Cabinets were broken into, purses stolen, anything remotely valuable on desks vanished. This happened the weekend after the explosion, before employees were let back in to leave their personal effects. Then, they brought in another group to move out the furniture/filing cabinets/etc. and bring them to temporary storage. Those cabinets were all broken into while in storage. Unsurprisingly, this was followed by a sudden rash of identity theft.<br/><br/>THEN, after all that, they were awarded the contract to repair the roof.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml?cid=65#addyourcomment" cid="65" subject="Re: Government Contracts..." cid="65" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_65" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml#c65">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml?threaded=true#c65">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">I can tell you about SAIC</h3><div class="cbody">One reason SAIC gets the big government contracts is because they have gobs of people on hand with security clearances and "government experience". They employ lots of ex-military, ex-law enforcement dead weight, people who deliberately or perhaps from sheer ignorance always create the only kind of workplace they know how to function (barely) in: massive, entrenched, indispensible-by-design bureaucracies that burn through cash with no accountability whatsoever.<br/><br/>The FBI's case-file computer system modernization project was on the ropes when they finally called in subcontractors with real-world experience, and by then it was too little too late; the cronyism and culture of paranoia had for too long produced a hyper-siloed workforce that not only had no idea what some of the most basic practices were in software development or what actual real-world code looks like, but also had entire "teams" of unfire-able nincompoops who couldn't talk to each other (for fear of disclosing classified info) all working in adjacent rooms on nearly identical tasks that somehow only served to sustain the work of some mystery person down the hall, and precious little of any of this busy-work actually advanced the goals of the overengineered project.<br/><br/>The scope of the NYC timesheet computerization project grew like a cancer, but they at least had some first-rate development talent pulled in from far &amp; wide (through subcontractors, mainly) from the get-go, and they did produce a real product that actually worked well enough to use and which could be supported by a small team of locals. However there was fierce opposition to the entire project from certain city labor groups the mayor was beholden to, groups who don't like the idea of computerized timesheets for some reason, so it eventually only rolled out to a fraction of the workforce. Oh, and there was apparently a huge amount of money being siphoned off in some cockamamie embezzlement scheme by some of the higher-ups whose actual jobs only consisted of touring the office every two months and encouraging everyone to keep up the good work.<br/><br/>So my impression of government IT contractors jives with Mike's... Even when SAIC has good people in the trenches, their projects always get sabotaged by incompetence, waste, and nepotism among the buffoons running the show. If anyone reading this has the opportunity to work for them, either run as fast as you can in the opposite direction, or be completely mercenary about it and bail at the first sign of trouble, before you get subpoenaed.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml?cid=204#addyourcomment" cid="204" subject="I can tell you about SAIC" cid="204" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_204" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml#c204">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml?threaded=true#c204">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">JavaScript, the Americans With Disabilities Act, and the Third Amendment.</h3><div class="cbody">One of Healthcare.gov's minor shortcomings is that, at last notice, it is JavaScript-dependent. To quote from the website:<br/><br/>"The page could not be loaded. The Healthcare.gov website currently does not fully support browsers with 'JavaScript' disabled. Please note that if you choose to continue without enabling 'JavaScript' certain functionality on this website may not be available."<br/><br/>They are saying, in effect, that they will not sell you insurance you are legally required to buy unless you let them run JavaScript programs on your computer. Granted, this is probably a case of Incompetence rather than Malice, but it still needs to be firmly stamped out.<br/><br/>Insistence on JavaScript, Flash, etc. for websites which perform essential government functions may not technically be a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act, but only technically. It is certainly a violation of the spirit. With a standard interface- such as "clean" HTML, assistive technologies can hook up to known connection points. JavaScript breaks these known connection points. Certainly, I don't think a sensible bureaucrat would want to go to court over the matter, when he could just as well fix the website.<br/><br/>It is sometimes claimed that websites need JavaScript for input validation. However, input validation in client-side scripts (Java/JavaScript/Flash/etc.) is a dumb idea. A "bot" can easily intercept such scripts, and impersonate them. Input validation should always be done on the server side. Client-side validation validates nothing.<br/><br/>Likewise, it is unnecessary to use scripts for basic site navigation, for getting from the main page to various subsidiary pages. This also relates to the Americans With Disabilities Act. Subsidiary pages should be described in words, encoded as letters, and more specifically, as ASCII codes, and the standard link tag allows one to associate a string of text with a URL. An assistive device can easily identify a link, and skip from link to link.<br/><br/>Beyond that, use of JavaScript is stupid. JavaScript is well known as the primary facilitator of computer viruses, botnets, etc., and trying to legally compel people to use it comes very close to intentional sabotage. I habitually boycott commercial businesses which attempt to insist on JavaScript.Client-side scripting is a form of "unsafe sex," dangerous to both parties. It facilitates attacks in which the bugs of client and server are cascaded off against each other; the creation of self-propagating bot-nets which flow back and forth between servers and clients.<br/><br/>Certain video-oriented applications use client-side scripting as a matter of necessity or expediency, to expand video or game-state data from its compactest form into video. However, this kind of thing cannot be considered necessary for selling insurance.<br/><br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>Indeed, compulsory Javascript may even be unconstitutional. In an article published twenty years ago Michael Swaine, of Dr. Dobb's Journal, pointed out that compulsorily installed software, such as JavaScript in this case, is a violation of the Third Amendment, which forbids quartering of soldiers in private houses. <br/> <br/> At the time, there was a minor uproar about a legal case known as Engblom vs. Carey. Ms. Engblom was a New York prison guard who lived in a state dormitory on the prison grounds, for which she paid rent, and had a lease, just like a college student. There was a prison guards strike, and she was immediately locked out of her dorm room. The dormitory was subsequently used to house National Guard troops who were being used as strikebreakers. When Ms. Engblom was eventually able to return to her room, she found that her belongings had been looted by the National Guard. Available accounts are not clear, but presumably the Guard made off with television sets, stereos, sporting goods, etc., the kinds of things which could be readily sold at the local pawnbrokers, and the state government probably told them, unofficially, that such items were legitimate plunder. Ms. Engblom eventually sued the state (more specifically, the governor, Hugh Carey), and, in a novel move, her lawyer added a third-amendment claim. This probably reflected the difficulties of pinning down responsibility for the looting. The Federal Court of Appeals decided that Engblom had a legitimate case, but let the state off the hook on a technicality.<br/><br/>Swaine worked up an argument about how this might apply to computers, specifically to compulsory anti-virus software. He pointed out that a "soldier" can be a man, but it can also be a war-robot, or even a computer program, and a "house" can be a computer. One cannot really eliminate the possibility that General Alexander, of the NSA, is trying to get _his_ code into Healthcare.gov. The idea would be to carry out JavaScript-bug-based attacks on every single computer in the country, install massive number of botnets, and spy on everyone's private papers.<br/><br/>Michael Swaine, "Swaine's Flames-- Dobbs v. United States," Dr Dobbs' Journal, December 01, 1993<br/><a href='http://www.drdobbs.com/swaines-flames/184409137' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://www.drdobbs.com/swaines-flames/184409137</a><br/><br/>About the same time that Swaine was writing, the lawyer Tom W. Bell did a law review article on the Third Amendment, in response to Engblom vs. Carey. He found that cases of quartering had happened during the Civil War, but that there had been no legal remedy, and hence no case law. Other than that, there were simply no precedents.<br/><br/><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engblom_v._Carey' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engblom_v._Carey</a><br/><br/>Tom W. Bell, "The Third Amendment: Forgotten but Not Gone," 2 William &amp; Mary Bill of Rights J. 117 (1993)<br/><a href='http://www.tomwbell.com/writings/3rd.html' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomwbell.com/writings/3rd.html</a><br/><br/>Of course, commenting on Bell, one might observe that there is a historical discussion of the Army's role in settlement, notably Richard C. Wade, _The Urban Frontier: The Rise of Western Cities_, 1790-1830 (1959), and Francis Paul Prucha, _Broadaxe and Bayonet: The Role of the United States Army in the Development of the Northwest, 1815-1860_ (1953). The gist of these is that the Army was way out in front of settlement during the nineteenth century, building roads, sawmills and other infrastructure, and founding cities, which started as forts. Far from the Army wanting to lodge with the civilians, it was the civilians wanting to lodge with the Army. This was a major reason why the Third Amendment was moot in peacetime. It's much the same reason that there are almost no early American cases of "enclosure" (ie. Kelo-type takings). The economy was running in precisely the opposite direction.<br/><br/>There were a couple of exceptional cases where the Army bought forts from the fur-trading companies (Ft. Laramie and Ft. Bridger, I believe). These fur-trading forts had been founded by permission of the local Indian tribe, and subject to the axiomatic condition that white farmers were not welcome in the vicinity. I understand that when the Army tried to acquire the first Bent's Fort, along the Arkansas River in Colorado, the owner, William Bent, burned it down and told them to make their own improvements. He then moved downriver to where his trading partners (**), the Cheyenne Nation were now living, and built a new fort.<br/><br/>(**) And relatives, Bent having married into the tribe.<br/><br/>Something similar was happing in eastern coastal cities. The Coast Artillery was changing from flat-trajectory muzzle-loaders, with an effective range of three miles or less, to breech-loading, high trajectory guns (battleship-type) with a range of ten miles or more. It was abandoning in-bay forts, and moving to forts on the most remote available barrier-islands, where these guns could be used effectively. In San Francisco, the Island of Alcatraz became a prison because it was surplus in its original role, a Coast Artillery fort. One can observe that the significant Coast Artillery forts of the Civil War, places like Ft. Sumter, are, to this day, separated from their cities by belts of water and swamp. They were far enough out that the Confederates had to fight battles to occupy them, rather than merely making uneventful arrests.<br/><br/>I don't know about some other eastern cities, but at least for Boston, the dominant tendency was to put new real-estate developments on landfills in swamps, simultaneously abating a nuisance of mosquito breeding grounds while creating favorably situated land. A classic example is the Back Bay, the defining example of posh uptown districts. The building developers did not try to redevelop the inner city, a la Baron Haussmann in Paris. Hence there were no Kelo-type cases. That was left to the late twentieth century.<br/><br/><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Eugene_Haussmann' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Eugene_Haussmann</a><br/><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haussmann's_renovation_of_Paris' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haussmann' s_renovation_of_Paris</a><br /><br />As  for  the  Third  Amendment  in  the  Civil  War,  one  must  not  view  it  in  isolation,  and  lose  sight  of  the  whole  atmosphere  of  dictatorship  which  the  war  brought  in.  Abraham  Lincoln  treated  the  Constitution  as  more  or  less  completely  optional,  to  be  dispensed  with  when  it  got  in  his  way.  This  was  perhaps  inevitable,  given  that  the  Chief  Justice,  Roger  B.  Taney,  was  a  secessionist  Marylander.  Justice  John  A.  Campbell,  from  Alabama,  resigned  in  1861,  and  entered  the  service  of  the  Confederate  government.  In  1862-64,  the  Supreme  Court  got  five  new  justices.  This,  of  course,  amounted  to  "Court  Packing,"  of  the  type  which  Franklin  Delano  Roosevelt  threatened,  but  did  not  actually  carry  out,  during  the  Great  Depression.  Other  incidents  included  the  arrest  and  deportation  of  Congressman  Clement  Vallandigham  of  Ohio.  Back  in  1993,  when  I  was  in  the  History  Department  at  Temple,  one  of  my  classmates  in  Professor  Russell  Weigley's  American  Military  History  seminar  did  a  paper  on  soldier  voting  in  the  Civil  War.  One  of  his  findings,  as  I  recall,  was  that  soldiers  were  brought  in  to  vote  in  doubtful  districts  in  states  like  Maryland,  Kentucky,  and  Missouri,  swamping  the  local  inhabitants.  The  breaches  of  the  Third  Amendment,  such  as  they  were,  occurred  in  a  context  in  which  the  whole  political  process  was  being  subverted.  That  is  why  presidents  in  difficulties,  such  as  President  Nixon  in  1973,  try  to  "wrap  themselves  in  Lincoln,"  by  way  of  saying  that  everything  is  permitted  to  them.<br /><br /><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Campbell' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Campbell</a><br /><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Vallandigham' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Vallan digham</a><br /><br />In  many  respects,  the  most  outrageous  single  action  of  the  Civil  War  was  the  execution  of  Mrs.  Surratt,  after  trial  by  a  military  commission.  Received  historical  opinion  is  that  she  was  hanged  as  a  kind  of  proxy  for  her  son,  who  had  made  good  his  escape.  The  normal  custom  of  the  time  and  after  was  that  ladies,  however  much  they  might  have  involved  themselves  in  political  conspiracies,  were  not  to  be  executed.  Cases  which  come  to  mind  are  the  American  Civil  War  spies  Rose  Greenhow  and  Belle  Boyd;  the  French  Commune  leaders  Hortense  David  and  Louise  Michel;  and  the  Irish  Rebel  leader  Constance  Gore-Booth  (Countess  Markiewicz)  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Irish  Easter  1916  Rising.  About  the  only  thing  which  could  get  a  woman  of  some  standing  (*)  hanged,  was  killing  her  husband  (petit  treason),  or  just  possibly,  her  husband's  children  from  a  previous  marriage.  See  Ann  Jones's  discussion  in  _Women  Who  Kill_  (1980),  particularly  the  case  of  Mary  Hartung,  a  boarding-house-keeper's  wife  who  gave  her  husband  rat  poison  because  he  was  a  rat.  To  put  it  in  our  terms,  you  do  not  _ever_  execute  a  twelve-year-old  girl  who  has  revenged  herself  on  her  molester,  even  if  she  has  reduced  him  to  hamburger  with  a  twelve-gauge  shotgun  and  a  couple  of  boxes  of  shells.  When  you  cross  that  line,  you  are  into  totalitarianism.<br /><br />In  short,  this  was  the  extremely  messy  context  in  which  the  comparatively  minor  offense  of  quartering  troops  took  place.<br /><br />(*)  the  type  who  employed  servants  instead  of  working  as  a  servant.  Before  mechanization  and  modern  plumbing,  the  most  basic  and  profound  social  distinction  was  who  cleaned  up  whose  filth,  eg  emptying  and  scrubbing  chamberpots.<br /><br /><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Surratt' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Surratt</a><br /><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Boyd' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Boyd</a><br /><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_O'Neal_Greenhow' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://e n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_O'Neal_Greenhow</a></div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml?cid=225#addyourcomment" cid="225" subject="JavaScript, the Americans With Disabilities Act, and the Third Amendment." cid="225" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_225" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml#c225">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml?threaded=true#c225">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: BUT MIKE (relativity Mike..... relativity)</h3><div class="cbody">+1  on  this.    I'm  a  fan  of  John  Green.    It  took  him  a  little  under  an  hour  to  apply  for  coverage  under  the  ACA,  even  with  multiple  server  failures.    He  only  had  to  answer  a  few  questions.    On  the  other  side,  took  him  over  2  hours  to  apply  on  a  site  that  was  available  both  before  and  after  ACA,  he  had  to  answer  pretty  much  every  health  question  imaginable  and  describe  every  visit  or  discussion  with  a  doctor  for  the  past  10  years.<br /><br />So  yes,  the  website  has  issues.    Yes,  it  should've  been  done  by  a  company  that  had  more  experience  on  the  web.    It  is  far  from  perfect.    But  despite  all  that,  it  is  still  better  than  what  was  there  before    (just  like  the  law  itself).

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: BUT MIKE (relativity Mike..... relativity)</h3><div class="cbody">Healthcare.gov  is  not  enrolling  large  numbers  of  people  into  plans.  The  old  system  was  not  great  but  one  could  buy  insurance  much  faster  than  with  Obamacare.  I  have  trying  to  find  what  plans  are  available  for  me  and  their  cost  since  Oct  1  with  absolutely  no  success  from  Healthcare.gov.  If  I  had  been  dealing  with  an  insurance  agent  or  company  before  Obamacare  I  would  have  some  preliminary,  non-binding  quotes  and  policy  information  within  a  few  minutes  (e.g.  company  x  will  cost  about  y  per  month  and  will/will  not  cover  this).  <br /> <br /> For  a  comparison,  look  at  auto  insurance.  True  one  has  to  comparison  shop  various  places  to  get  competitive  quotes.  When  one  wants  to  buy,  the  companies  try  to  make  a  user  friendly  as  possible.  Their  ability  to  get  new  customers  and  renewals  is  dependent  on  customers  being  able  to  efficiently  supply  the  information  and  get  an  accurate  price.  Even  the  comparison  shopping  is  relatively  easy  even  if  the  rates  are  not  binding.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml?cid=288#addyourcomment" cid="288" subject="Re: BUT MIKE (relativity Mike..... relativity)" cid="288" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_288" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml#c288">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml?threaded=true#c288">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Healthcare.gov snafu</h3><div class="cbody">It  can  be  said  that  if  you  want  to  completely  tie  your  hands  behind  you  and  learn  to  type  with  your  nose;  let  committee  and  govnment  contractors  write  up  three  years  of  "white  papers"  and    "needs  assessments".  <br /> <br /> Maybe,  MAYBE  in  10  years  you'll  get  a  system  that  was  designed  6  years  and  ten  OS's  ago  and  NO  ONE  will  even  think  to  update  the  tech,  data  support  or  software  si  that  your  state  of  the  art  system  will  be  defunct  before  you  even  get  to  ise  it;  and  due  to  conflicts  from  the  get  go,  wont  work  anywsy.<br /><br />Since  when  did  Big  Brother  adopt  MicroSoft's  tactic  of  letting  the  tech  savvy  "Joe  publics"  beta  test  a  system  AFTER  paying  for  it??<br /><br />Untuit  and  other  smart  companies  in  the  late  90's  and  early  oughtied;  learned  to  use  us  beta  testers  to  try  out  and  debug  the  system  BEFORE  letting  it  go  live.<br /><br />Some  how  all  that  seems  but  a  dream.<br />I  will  continue  to  ask  3  questions.<br />1.  How  many  states  with  democratic  leadership;  both  Federal  and  statewide,  have  had  no  real  issues  with  rollout,  ergo  2.  How  many  Republican  overrun  states  are  having  difficulties?<br />Lastly  but  most  importantly...<br />3.  How  could  anyone  in  their  right  mind  think  that  in  the  face  of  multiple  MILLIONS  of  employees  being  bamboozled  by  their  company  based  healthcare  enrollment  period,  think  that  opening  what  could  be  less  difficult,  better  coverage  and  easier  to  pay  for  exchanges  were  EVER  GOING  TO  WORK,  until  all  those  already  insured  captive  employee  health  insurance  policies  had  been  locked  in.<br /><br />I  can  almost  Guarantee  you  that  healthcare.  Gov  won't  work  until  every  last  employee  and  Medicare  enrolled  senior  has  been  Licked  into  their  2014  elected  healthcare  coverage.<br /><br />No  companies  are  giing  to  take  the  chance  that  their  convoluted  horrible  policies  ate  going  to  be  chucked  by  the  wayside  to  have  their  captive  employees  not  pay  a  large  share  of  big  business's  corporate  health  plans.<br />Same  with  Medicare.  We  won't  see  improvement  on  the  AFC  until  big  business  has  cut  their  losses  by  keeping  the  website  down  until  employees  can't  get  out  of  employer  based  healthcare.<br /><br />In  Florida  a  bill  was  passed  in  the  republican  held  Fl  legislature  and  Mr.  Scott  that  lets  all  health  insurance  companies  have  FREE  REIGN  to  charge  anything  they  want  to  for  two  whole  years  starting  this  enrollment  period.  And  all  they  have  to  use  to  justify  the  rate  hike  is  to  say  "That  it's  the  fault  of  "  Obama  care";  when  in  reality  it's  Gov.  Scott  amd  his  big  biz  cronies  wrecking  havoc  to  all  of  their  citizens.  The  insurance  commissioners  hands  are  supposedly  tied  because  Gov  Scott  signed  that  bill  into  the  laws  of  FL  for  the  next  2  years!<br />Disgusting.<br />TheHerbalCupboard</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml?cid=1096#addyourcomment" cid="1096" subject="Healthcare.gov snafu" cid="1096" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1096" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml#c1096">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131010/01484924821/why-healthcaregov-sucks-because-they-hired-political-cronies-not-internet-native-companies-to-build-it.shtml?threaded=true#c1096">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]
