<h1 class="posttitle">Cable Industry Finally Admits That Data Caps Have Nothing To Do With Congestion</h1><h3>from the <i>of-course-not</i> dept</h3><div class="postbody">
For years, the key rationale given by broadband providers for implementing data caps was that it was the only way they could deal with "congestion." Of course, for years, independent researchers showed that <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080806/0035521904.shtml">this was bogus</a>, and there was no data crunch coming. If you actually caught a <i>technologist</i> from a broadband provider, rather than a business person or lobbyist, they'd quietly admit that there was no congestion problem, and that <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070413/011103.shtml">basic upgrades</a> and network maintenance could easily deal with the growth in usage. But, of course, that took away the broadband providers' chief reason for crying about how they "need" data caps. The reality, of course, is that data caps are all about increasing revenue for broadband providers -- in a market that is already <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121220/12060521455/senator-wyden-proposes-bill-that-would-protect-users-bogus-data-caps.shtml">quite profitable</a>. But if they can hide behind the claims that they need to do this to deal with congestion, they can justify it to regulators and (they hope) the public.
<br/><br/>
Of course, enough people have been calling this explanation out as completely bogus that it appears that even the broadband companies' own lobbyists may finally be dropping this line of reasoning. Former FCC boss Michael Powell, who is now the cable industry's chief lobbyist (president of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association -- NCTA), has finally <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Cable-Industry-Finally-Admits-Caps-Not-About-Congestion-122791?utm_source=dlvr.it&#038;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">admitted caps aren't about congestion</a>:
<blockquote><i>
Michael Powell told a Minority Media and Telecommunications Association audience that cable's interest in usage-based pricing was not principally about network congestion, but instead about pricing fairness...Asked by MMTC president David Honig to weigh in on data caps, Powell said that while a lot of people had tried to label the cable industry's interest in the issue as about congestion management. "That's wrong," he said. "Our principal purpose is how to fairly monetize a high fixed cost."
</i></blockquote>
Of course, as Broadband Reports notes, Powell is jumping from one myth (congestion) to another (fairness) that is just as ridiculous. If it was true, we'd see at least some prices going down. But we don't.
<blockquote><i>
Except the argument that usaged pricing is about fairness has been <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/The-Bandwidth-Hog-is-a-Myth-117230">just as repeatedly debunked</a>. If usage caps were about "fairness," carriers would offer the nation's grandmothers a $5-$15 a month tier that accurately reflected her twice weekly, several megabyte browsing of the Weather Channel website. Instead, what we most often see are low caps and high overages layered <b>on top of</b> already high existing flat rate pricing, <u>raising rates for all users</u>. Does raising rates on a product that already sees 90% profit margins sound like "fairness" to you?
</i></blockquote>
Data caps are about one thing only: increasing profits for the broadband providers, who already have massive control over the market with limited competition. It's nice to see them give up on one myth (even if we still see pundits repeating it without criticism), but it would be nice if we could get past the others as well.</div>

<div class="cbody">If i were the owner of a isp I'd offer different tiers for the same pipe. For instance, if you wanted unlimited access you'd pay X. If you wasn't the type that had a heavy usage at peak times you'd get a nice discount in exchange for a reduced pipe during the peak. Or you can pay a premium to have an extra speed for when you are downloading that 10Gb 1080p movie.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that my network would be set up to deal with the entirety of the bw needed at peak times and if people wanted to keep their subscribed bw maxed 24/7 then so be it.<br/>

<div class="cbody">Any pricing of cable internet will be entirely arbitrary. The actual costs are almost entirely fixed and have nothing to do with the actual usage. ISPs behave like any "good" corporation should. Anything they say is just PR BS in their effort to squeeze as much money as possible out of existing infrastructure. And regulation will not help, only real competition will. Look at Canada if you need a proof. Here the owners of cable are common carriers and independent ISPs are free to offer internet access over that infrastructure. Yet the internet access still sucks. Common carriers can still charge any arbitrary amount to cover their "costs", they just charge the independent ISP first, who transfers the cost onto you.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?cid=305#addyourcomment" cid="305" subject="" cid="305" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_305" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml#c305">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?threaded=true#c305">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re: Re: Re:</h3><div class="cbody">They designed cable and ADSL (Asymmetrical DSL) that way on purpose. More channels are used for download than upload. It didn't originally have much to do with servers though. Servers were not really a thought at the time. It was more about how can we get more download speed to our customers because that is what they used the most of, so upload was sacrificed. SDSL for example, while offering much better upload speeds than ADSL, offers far slower download speeds. At the time these technologies were created, we didn't have online backup. We didn't often upload files to the internet except maybe email attachments. It doesn't take much upload for TCP connection to work, so there was no need to offer it.<br/>
<br/>
They have since begun bonding channels on cable to increase upload speed. DSL can use Annex M, but few companies in the US consider it worth the effort.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re:</h3><div class="cbody">You do realize that uploads speeds on many types of networks actually are lower due to technical restrictions right?<br/>
<br/>
For instance for cable service using DOCSIS 3.0 the Max speed per channel in the US is for 42.88 Mbps/per channel for Download and for Upload is only 30.72 Mbps/per channel. <br/>
<br/>
DOCIS 3.0 allows up to 8 download channels per node, but only 4 upload channels per node. That puts throughput per node at 343.04Mbps Down and 122.88 Mbps Up.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally cable providers may choose to use fewer upload (or download) channels so that they can provide more HD content, such as On Demand programming, but they will normally use 8 (or more) download channels to provide the best experience for the majority of users.<br/>
<br/>
So there are actual technical reasons why your upload speed is restricted.<br/>
<br/>
Because the majority of users don't need a lot of upload bandwidth it would make since to have a fixed rate for download (always at max available speed) and tiered pricing for upload speed increases. Say 2Mbps, 5Mbps and 10Mbps, that way you are paying for what is the choke point on the network.<br/>
<br/>
Also in support of not charging a premium for download speed, most major ISP's have caching to prevent having to actually fetch pages off the internet, instead they fetch a cached copy off their own network. Many streaming services such as Netflix, Akamai... have equipment located at the ISP so that content only has to travel the last mile and not across the globe.<br/>
<br/>
Just something to consider.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?cid=408#addyourcomment" cid="408" subject="Re:" cid="408" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_408" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml#c408">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?threaded=true#c408">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

If they had tiered pricing based on peak/off hours that would help distribute load and keep the local network from getting jammed up, but people would also hate it because those hours are peak for a reason. <br/>

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re:</h3><div class="cbody">The vast majority of users are 90% download, 10% upload. Market forces dictate that technology caters to what the majority requires. If we were to switch to a tech that gave 5Mb/5Mb, all it would do is result in complaints from the vast majority of people who have no need for 5Mb upload, but download much more than that - ie. all your netflix users, youtube users, hulu/iplayer users, bittorrenters etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this is limited by technology - your physical link to your ISP has a finite amount of spectrum. If you have 10Mb down and 1Mb up, in order to get 10Mb up, you'd have to drop to 1Mb down. It has absolutely nothing to do with 'censorship' and more with the laws of physics.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?cid=458#addyourcomment" cid="458" subject="Re: Re: Re:" cid="458" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_458" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml#c458">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?threaded=true#c458">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">The only blame here lies with stockholders and Wall Street. Companies that trade on Wall Street are continuously pushed to increase revenue and profit quarter over quarter lest they be judged as failures, at which point their stock price declines. The easiest way for companies to increase revenue is to milk their existing customers. With data caps, all you are seeing is a retooling of the back-end billing strategy to churn out further revenue from their existing customers. This is why you see the flat base price remain stagnant as offering a lower "$5-15" tier would cannibalize existing revenue and offset the additional revenue they make off the data cap overages, resulting in flat growth in Wall Street's eyes. This is how all publicly-traded companies operate. You can clearly see that other industries (banking, airlines, etc) do this same thing by increasing fees on every little thing. VMware tried it by changing their licensing structure with their 5.x series products so existing customers paid more. They only reneged after their customers revolted and the company awoke to the fact that the impending loss in revenue from the customers threatening to look elsewhere would not be offset by the increased costs on those who remained. In the end, the problem clearly lies with Wall Street culture. Until that is fixed, every company will nickle-and-dime their existing customer base in an effort to fudge their revenue numbers higher and higher quarter over quarter. They are beholden to their stockholders.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?cid=475#addyourcomment" cid="475" subject="" cid="475" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_475" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml#c475">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?threaded=true#c475">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re:</h3><div class="cbody"><i> "But these technical reasons were intentional design decisions, not some kind of inescapable limitation. "</i><br/>
<br/>
Well yes and no. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, DOCSIS is an international telecommunications standard, and design considerations do of course tend to favor the industries they serve.<br/>
<br/>
No, because many of the design limitations are required by technical limitations of the existing infrastructure. For cable systems, think of it like this. You are in a huge auditorium and there is one mic at a podium and a PA system. The Downstream bandwidth is like being at the podium and using the PA, it is easy for everyone to hear what is said. The upstream is like being out in the audience and shouting a question. It can be hard for the presenter to hear and nearly impossible if too many are yelling at once. Could those limitations be overcome, certainly, but not with the existing infrastructure. You would have to give everyone access to the same PA as the presenter, and then you are still limiting how many can effectively talk at once.<br/>
<br/>
If AT&amp;T were smart they would rip out every bit of copper and install fiber to every home, they could then compete directly with cable and offer many additional services as well. What they chose to do with UVerse was leave the copper for the last mile and set up nodes connected via fiber for the backhaul. This means that they are still constrained by the limitations of twisted pair copper. It also means that they only choose to serve densely populated areas where they can get the highest return on investment.<br/>
<br/>
<i>"I do wish it were possible to get real broadband without having to concede anything to cable television usage. Real upload speeds, no need to have a basic cable TV package I never use, etc. It would be great."</i><br/>
<br/>
I too would love to be able to get internet only and have many options where I live. But that is not likely to happen unless the government mandates sharing of the infrastructure and allows competition. If they don't mandate the sharing of the infrastructure there is no way to compete with the existing monopoly, the startup cost simply kill any incentive that there might be.<br/>
<br/>
Satellite can compete with cable ONLY because they don't need to build out infrastructure in each location. AT&amp;T can only competes by leveraging its existing infrastructure. The reason is share holders only care about the next dividend and even though fiber to the home would be a slam dunk for AT&amp;T long term, the short term pain would cause investors to flee. See Verizon for details, they tried it and abandoned the idea.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?cid=604#addyourcomment" cid="604" subject="Re: Re: Re:" cid="604" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_604" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml#c604">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?threaded=true#c604">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

This eliminates the number one problem for new providers, the cost of the infrastructure to provide the service. However, it introduces several other problems.<br/>

Personally, I think the government should not be involved in covering the cost only in mandating that the company that builds a system must lease (share) it to competitors for reasonable rates.

Of course, there are downsides as well. That's why I am asking for different input.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: You can't stockpile bandwidth</h3><div class="cbody">I would say that could be cured by doing away with the concept of private ownership of land. Land, as a resource no one ever created and one that is necessary for life itself, is not something we should be in the business of doling out to specific people. Land use needs to be largely communally governed.<br/>
<br/>
I do deeply sympathize though with the situation you describe. My only caveat is that you were the victim of a long tradition of attempting to assign ownership to something that simply cannot be fairly owned. <br/>
<br/>
Your own work, the fruits of your labor, and things you traded for are examples of things that are easily "personal property". But when you go to make something big enough that it obstructs other people's use of land, that begins to be something we all need to consult together about.<br/>
<br/>
Imminent domain is necessary in some cases to provide basic services.

Like the article tried to say, internet-cable congestion (which is most likely to occur on the narrow upstream) - can be remedied by "basic upgrades and network maintenance [which] could easily deal with the growth in usage.". That maintenance would include installing additional fiber-nodes in upstream-congested areas (the afore mentioned "system-maintenance"), which would reduce the traffic by half for each node, ad infinitum, as necessary. I wish the article stated more clearly that the caps are an industry strategy that keeps them from having to perform such maintenance.

The frequencies used for uploads are much fewer than the ones for download speeds over copper wire.<br/><br/>Now, once fiber optics are run to more homes, you will likely see an increase in upload speeds.<br/><br/>Problem is, most ISPs don't see the need for fiber yet, but they're slowly doing it anyway.<br/><br/>Most cable companies are already fiber to the neighborhood, and so are most DSL/phone companies. That last few thousand feet is where the vast majority of bottleneck is.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?cid=1757#addyourcomment" cid="1757" subject="Re:" cid="1757" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1757" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml#c1757">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?threaded=true#c1757">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Response to: Ninja on Jan 23rd, 2013 @ 5:38am</h3><div class="cbody">I am the technology manager for a smallish ISP. I like your thinking but here's why it won't work. <br/> <br/> 1. Having the bandwidth available for every user to max their connection is not economically feasible. Wholesale bandwidth raw costs are about a buck a meg. That's before we pay to get the bandwidth to your house which can add about 5-10 bucks easily. So that 20 meg home connection has a wholesale cost to the ISP of about $25. Now we have to pay for staff. Network hardware etc etc etc. this is why we use oversell. Generally we oversell by 6-20. Some providers do more. <br/> <br/> Regarding upload; it's available. Traditional technologies like DSL and cable aren't designed for symmetry because most users are downloading. That usage pattern is changing though. So many providers ( my company included) have begun to offer service that runs more to the symmetrical. We offer 30x30 for 99/month right now.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?cid=1797#addyourcomment" cid="1797" subject="Response to: Ninja on Jan 23rd, 2013 @ 5:38am" cid="1797" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1797" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml#c1797">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20130118/17425221736/cable-industry-finally-admits-that-data-caps-have-nothing-to-do-with-congestion.shtml?threaded=true#c1797">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

Remember this, theres 8 bits in a byte. When they advertise they use bits instead of bytes. Aka 10 megabit speeds download really fly's down to just above 1 megabyte download. And i dont know why but computers and software always use bytes instead of bits where isps use bits to seem faster.
