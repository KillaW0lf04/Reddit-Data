<h1 class="posttitle">Not Cool: MPAA Joins The W3C</h1><h3>from the <i>that's-not-going-to-end-well</i> dept</h3><div class="postbody">
The W3C has been at the forefront of open standards and an open internet for many years, obviously. So it's somewhat distressing to see it announced this morning that <a href="https://twitter.com/w3c/status/420548145102061568" target="_blank">the MPAA has now joined the group</a>. After all, it was not that long ago that the MPAA flat out tried to break the open internet by imposing rules, via SOPA, that would have effectively harmed security protocols and basic DNS concepts. All because it refuses to update its business model at the pace of technology. The MPAA has <i>never</i> been about supporting open standards or an open and free internet. The W3C states that its "principles" are "web for all, web for everything" and that its vision is "web of consumers and authors, data and services, trust." The MPAA has basically been opposed to... well.... all of that. It has tried to take a consumer web of authors and turn it into a broadcast medium for major producers. It's tried to destroy trust, and put in place locks and keys.
<br/><br/>
In short, the MPAA has no place at all in the W3C. If there had been any indication that this was a shift in the MPAA's thinking, that actually would be interesting. If the MPAA had shown even the slightest indication that it was finally willing to embrace real internet principles and standards, and move Hollywood into the 21st century, that would be a good thing, and they should participate. But that's not what this is about, at all.
<br/><br/>
Instead, I fear that this is because of the stupid fight, which the W3C supports, to <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130129/09264821815/truly-stupid-ideas-adding-drm-to-html5.shtml">put DRM in HTML5</a>. Tim Berners-Lee, who created the web and heads the W3C, has (for reasons that still don't make any sense) supported this dangerous proposal. Despite detailed explanations for why this is a bad idea, he has continued to <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130313/03554322310/disappointing-tim-berners-lee-defends-drm-html-5.shtml">defend the idea</a>, which appears to go against nearly everything he's said in the past. Having the MPAA join the W3C is not encouraging at all.
<br/><br/>
Berners-Lee's support of DRM in HTML5 seems to be based on the short-sighted (and simply wrong) idea that the web needs the legacy entertainment industry more than the legacy entertainment industry needs the web. Building truly open standards that the world adopts will get the MPAA and others to come along eventually, because they'll realize they need to go where the people are, even if it isn't crippled with restrictions and locks. Bringing the MPAA into the process only continues to perpetuate this idea that we should be building a broadcast platform for the entertainment industry to push a message at consumers, rather than building a platform for creators of all kinds to communicate and share.</div>

<h3 class="commentsubject">Legacy</h3><div class="cbody">We live in a world where legacy rules, unfortunately at the expense of all of us.<br/><br/>The establishment promise innovation and progress. Reality is stifling and lawsuits.<br/><br/>The MPAA represents stale old gatekeepers doing everything they can to keep the status quo as it was. If they had it their way, we would still be using wax cylinder tubes, scrolls hand written by monks and much worse. Instead, we now have DRM in all kinds of delicious flavors and bright colors. They are busy in their labs and meeting rooms concocting newer more invasive legacy building techniques of crippling our lives by giving us more of what they already know we don't want.<br/><br/>My prediction is that the MPAA will innovate by creating layers and layers of encrypted, invasive content protection, thus causing our computers to waste gigaflops of bandwidth decoding their newest DRM. They will Geolocate every IP address on the net and restrict where we can watch their precious content and even segregate which devices are allowed to display their content. This my friends is the new world order! They will also learn how many of us are watching their content, how old we are, where they live, how interested they are in it not only will they charge us dearly for this privilege, they will also be selling our own private data to whoever pays them the most, after they made us cough up enough money.<br/><br/>But boy will this be packaged in bright brilliant colors and brought to life in Digital Dolby + DTS multiplex 4D surround sound with bazillion mega pixels eating away at or monthly data caps. The party will be fantastic!<br/><br/>Let's not forget that all of this cool technology will come at a high price in license fees the browser companies will have to endure, because all of these bright colors and delicious sounds cost money. This will also be the downfall of this idea: no one will want to buy it. The standard will wither away and won't be implemented by many browsers since it's only a "standard" and for it to succeed, it will have to be implemented well. Only it can't be. It never has. This is DRM 16.100 and just like all the versions before it, it will succeed just as well.<br/><br/>Good luck guys! I won't be at the Gala.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?cid=333#addyourcomment" cid="333" subject="Legacy" cid="333" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_333" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml#c333">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?threaded=true#c333">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">A warning to the MPAA</h3><div class="cbody">The first thing you need to worry about is your reputation. Back before the Internet days this may not have been such a huge issue since no one really knew who you were and what you do but now your reputation is only getting worse. and as your reputation continues to get worse and worse and public backlash against you continues to grow the foundations of your stability will turn into a house of cards. Beware.<br/><br/>and, unlike before, the way to 'fix' your reputation is not by bullying your way into a good reputation. Trying to find ways to prohibit criticism or to buy politicians or promotional ads is not going to help. Trying to buy petition signatures is not going to work. Astroturfing will only make things worse. Trying to 'fix' your reputation the old way, by doing what you do best and bullying everyone simply won't cut it in this day and age and will only make things worse for you. You must act morally.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?cid=552#addyourcomment" cid="552" subject="A warning to the MPAA" cid="552" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_552" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml#c552">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?threaded=true#c552">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

The Wikimedia Foundation gets the vast majority of their funding from private donors, not corporations - "ad machines" or otherwise.

Wales himself receives no salary from the Wikimedia Foundation.<br/><br/>4. Google does not use Wikipedia content for anything that I'm aware of. Google search returns links to Wikipedia pages, but a link in a search result is hardly "free content." If it is, then they're also getting this "free content" from people who edit magazines and pay for health insurance and salaried writers, so your point is moot.<br/><br/>Your post is completely ridiculous on every level.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?cid=757#addyourcomment" cid="757" subject="Re: Re: Re: Congrats to the W3C" cid="757" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_757" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml#c757">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?threaded=true#c757">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Congrats to the W3C</h3><div class="cbody"><i> For some reason anyone who makes a living from the benefit of IP you don't care about.</i><br/><br/>Maybe it's because you're so focused on 'IP law' and how it can 'protect' you that <i> you</i> don't care about what it means for other people. How it can can have significant negative impacts on others. <br/> <br/> Want to create a lyrics site for your favorite band, because the band/label itself refuses to do so? Too bad.<br/><br/>Find a new artist and, in an attempt to share them with your friends and family you send them a track, or the songs so they can listen to, and possibly become fans as well? Enjoy the million dollar plus lawsuit.<br/><br/>Write a song that sounds a little <i> too</i> much like another one, either accidentally or perhaps because your song is meant as an homage to the other song/artist? Enjoy the lawsuit.<br/><br/>Steal(literally) a CD from a store? Slap on the wrist, minor fine. Download that same CD online? You're treated worse than if you'd stolen someone's car, with fines in the 5, 6, or 7 figure amount.<br/><br/>Make a review video for a game, movie, or even book, spending dozens of hours and work putting it together, before putting it on a site like YT? Enjoy having all of the profits from the video taken from you, due to a 5 second clip of music or video you included in it, by a system put in place in an attempt to appease the parasites.<br/><br/>Have a business and want to play the radio for your customers to listen to while they wait? It's counted as a 'public performance', and suddenly you'll find yourself threatened with fines and fees for it.<br/><br/>Have a business and want to have bands providing live entertainment for your customers, or perhaps have that <i> as</i> your business? Enjoy paying out the nose to 'collection agencies' because one of the bands <i> might</i> play a song that they own.<br/><br/>When the current IP law you say you depend on to make your living tramples all over people and their rights, making illegal human nature of creativity and sharing, don't be surprised when you don't exactly get a friendly reception defending it.<br/><br/>Now, to clarify, just because people are against IP law as it stands today, does <b> not</b> necessarily mean that they are against artists being able to make money off of their work, most people have no problem with an artist making a profit on their creations, what they're objecting to is how insane the laws have gotten, and the damage they cause. When downloading a CD's worth of songs is considered by the law to be a crime heinous enough to bankrupt a person for the rest of their <b> life</b>, something is seriously wrong.<br/><br/><i>You do realize that almost every product you use on a day to day basis exists as a result of IP</i><br/><br/>This again... There's a difference between 'made <i> because</i> of IP law' and 'made while IP law exists'. Saying that because IP laws exists, and someone made something, that makes the creation 'due to' IP law would make just as much sense if you swapped out 'hair' with 'IP laws'.<br/><br/>Very little I'd imagine is made <i> because</i> of laws in place. A writer with a story on their mind would not be likely to refuse to write if copyright law weren't around, same with an artist and their paintings, or a musician and their songs. <br/> <br/> <b> People create</b>, they always have, they always will. Claiming that IP law is responsible for people creating requires ignoring the vast majority of human history when those laws <i> didn't exist</i>, and yet creation still took place.<br/><br/><i>...not to mention the computer you wrote this comment with.</i><br/><br/>Which likely <b> would not exist</b> had today's IP laws been in place when it was originally being developed. Patent and copyright trolls are nasty enough today, crushing smaller businesses with massive 'license fees' and court costs, imagine how bad the damage they could have done when the technology behind computing was just getting going?<br/><br/><i>I am tired of this statement. I have made copies of my CDs and nobody came to my house. Nor has anyone come to your house.</i><br/><br/>Yet the fact remains, due to the bought and paid for laws, you almost certainly <i> broke the law</i> doing so, and if someone cared to, they could drag you to court and hit you with a massive fine for doing so.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?cid=909#addyourcomment" cid="909" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Congrats to the W3C" cid="909" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_909" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml#c909">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?threaded=true#c909">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

It's obvious why Mozilla is not in this group. This cannot possibly be good for Firefox, my favorite browser for privacy and security. I'm having a hard time understanding their plan for open source browsers. This is what they have today (emphasis added):<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>5. Simple Decryption<br/><br/>All user agents must support the simple decryption capabilities described in this section regardless of whether they support <b> a more advanced CDM</b>. This ensures that there is <b> a common baseline</b> level of protection that is <b> guaranteed to be supported in all user agents</b>, <b> <i> including those that are entirely open source</i></b>. Thus, content providers that need only <b> basic protection</b> can build <b> simple applications</b> that will work on all platforms without needing to work with any content protection providers. <br/> </blockquote> <br/> <br/> What exactly does this "basic protection" that open source browsers will be limited to provide? What is a "simple application"? <br/> <br/> You look under this, and unless I'm missing something, all they have for open source browsers is <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/tip/encrypted-media/encrypted-media.html#simple-decryption" rel="nofollow"> an encryption key for clear text</a>!

<div class="cbody">Next years news will be:<br/><br/>MPAA drops out of the W3C consortium because it is unable to enact any of its proposals, the process is to open to be of any use.<br/><br/>No I don't like it, I know the MPAA is toxic and most of their proposals will be toxic, still maybe is time to see how well the system works when toxic waste is introduced in its inner workings, so albeit a bit sad is also exciting.<br/><br/>Why exciting? because I believe that an open process cannot be undermined easily, I believe an open process is more resilient with little chance of failing completely, maybe this is the time that the MPAA realize what they are up against and if it fails well back to the drawing board, get all the lessons learned and do it again.<br/><br/>Yes people the MPAA is powerful, yes people the MPAA is not made up of complete idiots they have very intelligent people who rose to the top because they were able to bend the rules of time and space but even them can become anachronistic because this is a dynamic universe not a static one, environments change and the dominant parties at one time become the losers in the next time frame, and I hope that the open process time has come and can survive on its own in this very hostile environment, well I am hoping for it to thrive too, wouldn't that be something?<br/><br/>Everything is done in public, there are no secrets, there are no lies to be told that can't be found out.<br/><br/>This time nest year we could all be laughing at how the MPAA met its Waterloo LoL<br/><br/>or not.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?cid=1000#addyourcomment" cid="1000" subject="" cid="1000" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1000" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml#c1000">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?threaded=true#c1000">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Congrats to the W3C</h3><div class="cbody">Want to create a lyrics site for your favorite band, because the band/label itself refuses to do so? Too bad.<br/><br/>Yes the band doesn't want their lyrics reproduced but you have an inherent right to do so, yes? You have a right to make a website and how dare they? The indignation, that someone who made or controls the work does what they want with it. <br/> <br/> <br/> "Find a new artist and, in an attempt to share them with your friends and family you send them a track, or the songs so they can listen to, and possibly become fans as well? Enjoy the million dollar plus lawsuit."<br/><br/>If you sent a CD of you favorite band to your friends and family you would get sued? Not if you bought it. When I turn my friends and family on to new music I generally tell them the name of the group and they go look it up on Youtube. I am not sure when you were sued for millions but do tell. <br/> <br/> <br/> "Write a song that sounds a little too much like another one, either accidentally or perhaps because your song is meant as an homage to the other song/artist? Enjoy the lawsuit."<br/><br/>Incredible generalization, but for the sake of argument I'll run with it. The only reason you would get sued is if there is money involved. Did you rip off the song? Was it really a accident? Are you selling it? If you heard it on the radio or you heard it before( if you had access) yup, prob gonna get sued. If it is as a homage ( a cover) the original artist shouldn't get some money when you do? Why not? Didn't they write the song? Isn't giving them some money the ultimate in homage?<br/><br/> "Make a review video for a game, movie, or even book, spending dozens of hours and work putting it together, before putting it on a site like YT?" <br/> <br/> I would argue fair use, but you know what? Youtube is a commercial entity and as such they do what they want. Yes, their content ID needs to be changed .....but want to keep the money from your review, don't use any video you don't own or music that is not yours or....... license it.....I know that is an odd thought. <br/> <br/> "Have a business and want to play the radio for your customers to listen to while they wait?"<br/><br/>If it is the commercial radio or Tv, you got no worries mate. Hmm, I guess you could pay for a service right? You see you are getting a commercial benefit from playing the music(customers staying and buying cause they like the music) but you don't want to pay for it, Why not?<br/><br/>"making illegal human nature of creativity and sharing, ."<br/><br/>This is always my favorite. It diminishes the works and rights of the creator because this is what we humans do, we share right? There is a fundamental difference between back in the olden days and now, capitalism. <br/> <br/> <br/> "There's a difference between 'made because of IP law' and 'made while IP law exists'. Saying that because IP laws exists, and someone made something, that makes the creation 'due to' IP law would make just as much sense if you swapped out 'hair' with 'IP laws'."<br/><br/><br/>Of course......I often feel I must voice my opinion because there is often only one flavor of Kool aid available on this site.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?cid=1011#addyourcomment" cid="1011" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Congrats to the W3C" cid="1011" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1011" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml#c1011">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?threaded=true#c1011">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

The only people who would be interested in a song's lyrics are either a) fans of the song, who want to know what exactly is being sung, or b) someone who heard the song, didn't know what it was called or who made it, and wanted to find out. <br/> <br/> The first is likely a person who's already bought the music, the second is someone who is likely to buy it, as if they're that interested in finding the song, give them a chance to buy and they'll probably take it.<br/><br/><i>If you sent a CD of you favorite band to your friends and family you would get sued? Not if you bought it. When I turn my friends and family on to new music I generally tell them the name of the group and they go look it up on Youtube. I am not sure when you were sued for millions but do tell.</i><br/><br/>I was talking about digital files, not CD's(who buys those anymore?), and with the huge number of lawsuits over people sharing or downloading music, such an act would certainly put you in the crosshairs of some lawyer were it to be made public.<br/><br/>Also, as far as the youtube angle there, how many of the songs you direct them to are put up by the band itself, vs fans who want to share the music?<br/><br/><i>Incredible generalization-</i><br/><br/>Not as much as you might think.

'Fair use' does not equal 'Paid use', no matter how much some industry people may wish it did. The <b> entire point</b> of fair use is that you <i> don't</i> have to pay, ask permission, or otherwise 'license' a work to use it in a fair use manner.<br/><br/><i>If it is the commercial radio or Tv, you got no worries mate.</i><br/><br/>You'd <i> think</i> so, but...<br/><br/>Small business with the radio on in the background:<br/><a href='http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090202/0128383597.shtml' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090202/0128383597.shtml</a><br/><br/>Woman playing the radio <i> to her <b> horses</b></i>:<br/><a href='http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090327/1113014276.shtml' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090327/1113014276.shtml</a><br/><br/><b>Never</b> underestimate the greed of these people, if there's even the <i> possibility</i> that they could squeeze another cent out of someone, <b> they will take it</b>, rationality or sanity be damned.<br/><br/><i>Hmm, I guess you could pay for a service right? You see you are getting a commercial benefit from playing the music(customers staying and buying cause they like the music) but you don't want to pay for it, Why not?</i><br/><br/>First of all, who goes to, and buys stuff from, a store just because they like what's playing on the radio? Saying that having some background music is providing a 'commercial benefit' seems to be really stretching things. <br/> <br/> Also, if you're going to go that route, that the music playing in the background brings people in, and therefor the store owes someone money, then the reverse would be true too, it's possible that there would be people who would <i> avoid</i> the store(personally I wouldn't spend much time in a store if they were playing something like rap or country) because of the music, so the other groups should pay the <i> store</i> for potential 'lost customers'.<br/><br/>As for why they shouldn't have to pay for it, radio is free to listen to, why should suddenly having multiple people listen to it require the exchange of money(an <i> additional </i> exchange I should say, the radio station likely <i> already</i> paid to play the music)?<br/><br/><i>This is always my favorite. It diminishes the works and rights of the creator because this is what we humans do, we share right? </i> <br/> <br/> No actually, what it does is brings the 'creators' back down with the rest of the people. Rather than being treated all special because they 'create stuff', it's a realization that <i> everyone</i> creates, everyone takes in and is inspired by the world and culture around them, and it shapes the creation of more culture, more creations. <br/> <br/> It's pointing out that creation isn't a matter of 'Creator makes something completely original, public consumes/enjoys it until the next work is released', but rather 'Creator is inspired/influenced by something, creates their work, public is in turn inspired/influenced by that, creates <i> their</i> work(s), which creator is in turn inspired/influenced by...'.<br/><br/><i>There is a fundamental difference between back in the olden days and now, capitalism. </i> <br/> <br/> How so? People have always created, people have always sold or shared their creations. Are you really going to claim that the idea of being paid for a work only sprang into being recently? <br/> <br/> <i> Of course......I often feel I must voice my opinion because there is often only one flavor of Kool aid available on this site.</i><br/><br/>And you were doing so well too... you should realize that as soon as you start tossing out phrases like 'drinking the Kool aid', you've pretty much admitted that you're not interested in hearing from the other side, or giving their arguments a fair consideration, and will be ignored in return.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?cid=1163#addyourcomment" cid="1163" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Congrats to the W3C" cid="1163" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1163" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml#c1163">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?threaded=true#c1163">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

Look, buddy, if you only sold it in physical format and there was no internet, guess what? People would still copy and share it if they liked it enough. You're doin' it wrong, and why?

The world - and the internet - don't work the way you want them to and since you're a little guy the alleged protections don't apply to you, which means that the best you can hope for is to ride on the coattails of the industry bigwigs. <br/> <br/> Here's a bit of fun for you:<br/><br/><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimba_the_White_Lion#The_Lion_King_controversy' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimba_the_White_Lion#The_Lion_King_controversy</a><br/><br/>Whatever will you do if this happens?

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Congrats to the W3C</h3><div class="cbody">"They're called 'fans', you know, people who like a band/artist/writer, and so want to share what they like with other people?"<br/><br/>Sounds like a bad PR move but there is no inherent right of the fan to reprint the work of someone else. Sorry. <br/> <br/> "And pray tell, how exactly does a lyric site harm a band."<br/><br/>I didn't say it did. If the artist/ right holder doesn't want a site with their lyrics on them that is their right. They control reproduction of their work.<br/><br/>"the huge number of lawsuits over people sharing or downloading music"<br/><br/>Your numbers above about digital downloads are informative however, I would point out the decline in sales started in 1999, when P2P for music began. They are not an accurate representation missing seven years of data. I agree with you that piracy was mostly a service issue and has stabilized and I think the MPAA needs to realize this. They must change the way they are getting their product to their customers. <br/> <br/> "as far as the youtube angle there, how many of the songs you direct them to are put up by the band itself, vs fans who want to share the music?"<br/><br/> And people wonder why youtube gets sued all the time and is beginning to be hyper-reactive to rights holders. They have created a platform where people who don't own and haven't created a work can put it up and play it at will. In essence creating a video jukebox. Youtube is expected to have generated $5.6 billion for 2013. Content creators rightfully request if using my material to make money then you must pay for the use. Youtube is a company and as such their policies as to their platform are their own. If they don't want to risk the headache of dealing with a right holder claiming use of something on their platform that is their prerogative. To place any amount of someone else's music to film or video requires you pay the right holder.<br/><br/>"So first you argue for fair use, then you argue against it by claiming 'just license it'. 'Fair use' does not equal 'Paid use', no matter how much some industry people may wish it did."<br/><br/>I said I would argue fair use. To avoid any hassle and if I really wanted to use the clip or music I would probably license it. The choice is yours. <br/> <br/> "First of all, who goes to, and buys stuff from, a store just because they like what's playing on the radio? Saying that having some background music is providing a 'commercial benefit' seems to be really stretching things."<br/><br/>I did not say that people go to a store to hear music, I said there was a commercial benefit. If the music didn't enhance the shopping experience then no business would play it, no? If it had no benefit then why do want to play music in your store anyway? There must be a reason you want to play music in your store, what could it be?<br/><br/>"As for why they shouldn't have to pay for it, radio is free to listen to, why should suddenly having multiple people listen to it require the exchange of money(an additional exchange I should say, the radio station likely already paid to play the music)?"<br/><br/>I state again, if in the US, you can play music from the radio or tv in your store without a care.<br/><br/>"No actually, what it does is brings the 'creators' back down with the rest of the people."<br/><br/>All the creator wants is to have the ability to commercially maximize their creation. If everyone creates then what does the term "talent" mean? Yes everyone can sing a song but for some reason many people want to hear the voice of one person over that of another. Anyone that is good at what they do should be compensated as such.<br/><br/>"you've pretty much admitted that you're not interested in hearing from the other side."<br/><br/>This is patently false. I read every argument and rationally think about it. If I didn't I wouldn't bother posting. If you felt the mention of Kool-aid was offensive I will refrain. I like Grape.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?cid=1656#addyourcomment" cid="1656" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Congrats to the W3C" cid="1656" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1656" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml#c1656">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?threaded=true#c1656">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re: Re: A warning to the MPAA</h3><div class="cbody">If they can snag up any other negative press than pure legislative proposals and softening of politicians I bet you, they will go there in a heartbeat. They already influence science in the field by sponsoring some research on account of other research as well as taking to the courts... It is just what they are born to do. Manipulating legislators is a bad strategy regardless. You need to hold the argument and by choosing research and court filings to support you can somewhat control the information behind legislation.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Congrats to the W3C</h3><div class="cbody"><i> Sounds like a bad PR move but there is no inherent right of the fan to reprint the work of someone else. Sorry. </i> <br/> <br/> True, legally at least they are in the right for something like that, but that doesn't stop it from being an incredibly stupid move on their part, to shut down something put together by fans, fans who are only trying to share their love of a band.<br/><br/><i>I didn't say it did. If the artist/ right holder doesn't want a site with their lyrics on them that is their right. They control reproduction of their work.</i><br/><br/>Here's where it can get into a sort of gray area. A straight up lyrics site, is, at least according to the laws, treading on thin ice, and could be shut down. However not too long ago another example was brought up discussing a site that also posted song lyrics, but did so in order for people to deconstruct them, to analyses them and discuss various meanings they could hold. <br/> <br/> Something like that would likely very much fall into the fair use category, as the lyrics were being posted in order for people to give commentary and analysis on them.<br/><br/>So to say 'they control reproduction of their work' is true, but not in all cases. <br/> <br/> <i> Your numbers above about digital downloads are informative however, I would point out the decline in sales started in 1999, when P2P for music began. They are not an accurate representation missing seven years of data.</i> <br/> <br/> True, the data, at least from what I saw didn't go back that far, but I'd argue that the main reason album sales might have took a dive around there, and it's something the labels <i> could</i> have fought(similar to how services like iTunes did later), was that for the first time in a long while it was possible to get <b> a</b> song, one or two good songs from an album, and not have to buy an entire CD, one padded out with a bunch of mediocre songs, in order to have access to the handful the person actually wanted.<br/><br/>The data has shown, offer people a service that gives them what they want, at a decent price and without too many strings attached, and they <i> <b> are</b></i> willing to pay, it's just that for so long the labels had been making major money selling entire albums, the idea of people being able to pay less money for <i> only</i> the songs they wanted, was all but unthinkable to them, so for the longest time they refused to offer such, and piracy stepped in and offered what they refused to.<br/><br/>Doesn't make the piracy right mind, but it does explain why it would have been so prevalent for so long, before competing services popped up.<br/><br/><i>I agree with you that piracy was mostly a service issue and has stabilized and I think the MPAA needs to realize this. They must change the way they are getting their product to their customers.</i><br/><br/>Unfortunately, their way of 'changing' is the same it's always been, purchase laws in order to lock out competition, and keep things in the 'golden age' where they had all the control. It might take a while, but give it some time, and they'll either adapt and move onto how things work today, or die out as they're replaced by more flexible groups.<br/><br/><i> To place any amount of someone else's music to film or video requires you pay the right holder.</i><br/><br/>They tried to pick a sort of 'middle path' regarding that, with their ContentID system, it's just the execution of it is so borked, and prone to abuse, it's almost worst than having no system at all. <br/> <br/> Also, as I've noted before, that statement is <b> not</b> correct, fair use rules state that if you're using part of a work for commentary purposes, like say a review, you <i> don't</i> need to pay anyone. The problem is, 'fair use' is something that can be tricky to determine at times, and needs to be examined on a case by case basis, which is something the big players absolutely <b> hate</b>, as their preferred method of dealing with that sort of thing is 'claim everything we can, crush what we can't', so it's no surprise they'd always argue against fair use, means less work for them.<br/><br/><i>I said I would argue fair use. To avoid any hassle and if I really wanted to use the clip or music I would probably license it. The choice is yours. </i> <br/> <br/> An act that while legally safer(usually), very much does not help, as it furthers the idea of 'Fair use = Paid use'.<br/><br/><i>I did not say that people go to a store to hear music, I said there was a commercial benefit. If the music didn't enhance the shopping experience then no business would play it, no? If it had no benefit then why do want to play music in your store anyway? There must be a reason you want to play music in your store, what could it be?</i><br/><br/>The same could be said of quality carpets, decent AC/heating, lights that don't give people headaches from being under them for a while, and a whole slew of other things, why is it that in the case of radio the potential 'commercial benefit' means that the owners of the songs(which are very rarely the musicians themselves if you're talking about a major label musician) should be paid yet again(as I've noted before, the station playing the music likely already paid to do so, and possibly even <i> was paid</i>, indirectly, to play certain music)?<br/><br/>As for why, at a guess I'd say it's because most people don't like silence, having some music playing in the background helps that out.<br/><br/><i>I state again, if in the US, you can play music from the radio or tv in your store without a care.</i><br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's not likely to stop a collection agency or two from trying to shake the store down for whatever cash they think they can get away with. I really wasn't exaggerating earlier when I said they are some of the most greedy groups around.<br/><br/><i>All the creator wants is to have the ability to commercially maximize their creation. If everyone creates then what does the term "talent" mean? Yes everyone can sing a song but for some reason many people want to hear the voice of one person over that of another. Anyone that is good at what they do should be compensated as such.</i><br/><br/>To some extent I agree, to some extent I disagree. <br/> <br/> I do agree that a creator deserves the <i> opportunity</i> to profit off of their work, but the idea that they <i> deserve</i> to make money off of their creation is one I cannot agree with, as it seems to put the act of creation as higher importance than the quality or 'worth' that society attached to a work, basically saying 'I made something, and even if no one actually wants it, I deserve to be paid for my work regardless'.<br/><br/>Regarding the 'talent' bit, while it's true there are people who are more well known, more popular and skilled, and able to get attention and money from their creations, what I object to is the idea that <i> only</i> their creations 'count', or that they somehow created something in a vacuum, ignoring how culture is shaped and shapes the creation of everything, nor just the (relatively) few people who are able to make money or gain attention from it.<br/><br/><i>This is patently false. I read every argument and rationally think about it. If I didn't I wouldn't bother posting. If you felt the mention of Kool-aid was offensive I will refrain. I like Grape.</i><br/><br/>In that case I apologize for the mis-characterization and any offense, just know that in most cases, 'drinking the Kool-aid', or variations of that phrase, is pretty much calling the person you're addressing it to a person who blindly accepts what they're told and parrots it without thought, and so is generally considered pretty insulting, and will be taken as such.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?cid=1788#addyourcomment" cid="1788" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Congrats to the W3C" cid="1788" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1788" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml#c1788">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140107/11263425789/not-cool-mpaa-joins-w3c.shtml?threaded=true#c1788">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

You have an inherent right to free speech, even if you're repeating the speech of others. You have an inherent right to the results of your labor, even if those results are the same as the results of someone else's labor. You have an inherent right to private posession, even if you're creating copies of your private posessions to give (or even sell) to others.<br/><br/>What there is not, is an inherent right for me to take those rights away from you. I do have such rights under copyright law, but they are not <strong> inherent</strong> rights; they are solely a creation of the State.<br/><br/>Whether it is good or bad that the State remove those rights is an open question. But if we're talking about copyright, it's the only question possible.<br/><br/><em>Your numbers above about digital downloads are informative however, I would point out the decline in sales started in 1999, when P2P for music began.</em><br/><br/>The decline in sales didn't start until 2001, which (coincidentally) was when Napster was shut down. And they didn't reach the low levels that we had in 1982, the year the CD was introduced, until 2009.<br/><br/><em>I state again, if in the US, you can play music from the radio or tv in your store without a care.</em><br/><br/>No, you can't. You may have to pay licenses to rights holders to do so. Certain public performances of over-the-air radio and TV broadcasts are exempted, but by no means all of them.
