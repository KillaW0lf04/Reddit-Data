<h1> The Story of the PING Program </h1>
</center>

<p>
Yes, it's true!  I'm the author of
	<b>ping</b> for UNIX.
Ping is a little thousand-line hack that I wrote in an evening which
practically <em>everyone</em> seems to know about. :-)

<p>
I named it after the sound that a
sonar makes, inspired by the whole principle of echo-location.
In college I'd done a lot of modeling of sonar and radar systems,
so the "Cyberspace" analogy seemed very apt.
It's exactly the same paradigm applied to a new problem domain:
ping uses timed IP/ICMP ECHO_REQUEST and ECHO_REPLY packets
to probe the "distance" to the target machine.

<p> My original impetus for writing PING for 4.2a BSD UNIX came from
an offhand remark in July 1983 by Dr. Dave Mills while we were attending
a DARPA meeting in Norway, in which he described some work that he
had done on his "Fuzzball" LSI-11 systems to measure path latency
using timed ICMP Echo packets.

<p>
In December of 1983 I encountered some odd behavior of
the IP network at BRL.
Recalling Dr. Mills' comments, I quickly coded up the PING
program, which revolved around opening an ICMP style SOCK_RAW AF_INET
Berkeley-style socket(). The code compiled just fine, but it didn't work --
there was no kernel support for raw ICMP sockets!
Incensed, I coded up the kernel support and had
everything working well before sunrise.  Not surprisingly, Chuck Kennedy
(aka "Kermit") had found and fixed the network hardware before I was
able to launch my very first "ping" packet.  But I've used it a few
times since then. *grin*  If I'd known then that it would be my most
famous accomplishment in life, I might have worked on it another day or two
and added some more options.

<p>
The folks at Berkeley eagerly took back my kernel modifications and the
PING source code, and it's been a standard part of Berkeley UNIX ever since.
Since it's free, it has been ported to many systems since then,
including Microsoft Windows95 and WindowsNT.
You can identify it by the distinctive messages that it prints,
which look like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
PING vapor.arl.army.mil (128.63.240.80): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 128.63.240.80: icmp_seq=0 time=16 ms
64 bytes from 128.63.240.80: icmp_seq=1 time=9 ms
64 bytes from 128.63.240.80: icmp_seq=2 time=9 ms
64 bytes from 128.63.240.80: icmp_seq=3 time=8 ms
64 bytes from 128.63.240.80: icmp_seq=4 time=8 ms

----vapor.arl.army.mil PING Statistics----
5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip (ms)  min/avg/max = 8/10/16
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In 1993,
ten years after I wrote PING,
the USENIX association presented me with a handsome scroll,
pronouncing me a
Joint recipient of The USENIX Association 1993
<b>Lifetime Achievement Award</b>
presented to the Computer Systems Research Group, University of California
at Berkeley 1979-1993.

unparalleled service to our Community.

Wow!

From my point of view
PING is <em>not</em> an acronym
standing for Packet InterNet Grouper,
it's a sonar analogy.
However, I've heard second-hand that Dave Mills
offered this expansion of the name,
so perhaps we're both right.
Sheesh, and I thought the government was bad about expanding acronyms! :-)

<p> Phil Dykstra added ICMP Record Route support to PING, but in those
early days few routers processed them, making this feature almost
useless. The limitation on the number of hops that could be recorded
in the IP header precluded this from measuring very long paths.

<p>
I was insanely jealous when Van Jacobson of LBL used my
kernel ICMP support to write TRACEROUTE, by realizing that he could get
ICMP Time-to-Live Exceeded messages when pinging by modulating the IP
time to life (TTL) field.  I wish I had thought of that! :-)
Of course, the real traceroute uses UDP datagrams because
routers aren't supposed to generate ICMP error messages for ICMP messages.

<p>
The best ping story I've ever heard was told to me at a USENIX conference,
where a network administrator with an intermittent Ethernet had linked
the ping program to his vocoder program, in essence writing:

<blockquote><pre>
ping goodhost | sed -e 's/.*/ping/' | vocoder
</pre></blockquote>

He wired the vocoder's output into his office stereo and turned up
the volume as loud as he could stand.  The computer sat there shouting
"Ping, ping, ping..." once a second,
and he wandered through the building wiggling Ethernet
connectors until the sound stopped.  And that's how he found the
intermittent failure.

<h4>
Reviews
</h4>

<p>
The tale of a little duck alone on the Yangtze River, The Story About Ping is
a sweet and funny book with wonderfully rich and colorful illustrations. On a
day like any other, Ping sets off from the boat he calls home with his
comically large family in search of "pleasant things to eat." On this
particular day, he is accidentally left behind when the boat
leaves. Undaunted, the little duck heads out onto the Yangtze in search of his
family, only to find new friends and adventures--and a bit of peril--around
every bend.

<p>
The exceptional illustrations bring the lush Yangtze to life, from Ping's
family to the trained fishing birds he finds himself among to the faithfully
rendered boats and fishermen. Certainly intended to be read aloud, The Story
About Ping deserves a place on every young reader's (or listener's)
shelf. (Picture book)

A reader from Upper Volta, Uzbekistan, March 7, 1999

<p>
Excellent, heart-warming tale of exploration and discovery. Using deft
allegory, the authors have provided an insightful and intuitive explanation of
one of Unix's most venerable networking utilities. Even more stunning is that
they were clearly working with a very early beta of the program, as their book
first appeared in 1933, years (decades!) before the operating system and
network infrastructure were finalized.

<p>
The book describes networking in terms even a child could understand, choosing
to anthropomorphize the underlying packet structure. The ping packet is
described as a duck, who, with other packets (more ducks), spends a certain
period of time on the host machine (the wise-eyed boat). At the same time each
day (I suspect this is scheduled under cron), the little packets (ducks) exit
the host (boat) by way of a bridge (a bridge). From the bridge, the packets
travel onto the internet (here embodied by the Yangtze River).

<p>
The title character -- er, packet, is called Ping. Ping meanders around the
river before being received by another host (another boat). He spends a brief
time on the other boat, but eventually returns to his original host machine
(the wise-eyed boat) somewhat the worse for wear.

<p>
The book avoids many of the cliches one might expect. For example, with a
story set on a river, the authors might have sunk to using that tired old plot
device: the flood ping. The authors deftly avoid this.

<p>
Who Should Buy This Book

<p>
If you need a good, high-level overview of the ping utility, this is the
book. I can't recommend it for most managers, as the technical aspects may be
too overwhelming and the basic concepts too daunting.

<p>
Problems With This Book

<p>
As good as it is, The Story About Ping is not without its faults. There is no
index, and though the ping(8) man pages cover the command line options well
enough, some review of them seems to be in order. Likewise, in a book solely
about Ping, I would have expected a more detailed overview of the ICMP packet
structure.

<p>
But even with these problems, The Story About Ping has earned a place on my
bookshelf, right between Stevens' Advanced Programming in the Unix
Environment, and my dog-eared copy of Dante's seminal work on MS Windows,
Inferno. Who can read that passage on the Windows API ("Obscure, profound it
was, and nebulous, So that by fixing on its depths my sight -- Nothing
whatever I discerned therein."), without shaking their head with deep
understanding. But I digress.

I collect reference books about the UNIX operating system. PING (short
for Packet InterNet Groper) has always been one of those UNIX commands
whose usefulness transcends its own simplicity. A coworker told me about
a book dedicated to this one command, "The Story About PING." I was a
little surprised that an entire book was devoted to the history of this UNIX
command, but the price was certainly affordable, so I ordered it from a
distributor. What arrived was actually an illustrated story book for young
children. I thought it was a mistake, but my coworker told me later he was
just playing a prank. I did read the book on the plane while traveling on
business, and I have to admit, it's one of the finest pieces of children's
literature I have ever read. A classic tale of adventure and innocence, with
an important lesson to be learned. Not what I originally expected, but an
enjoyable read none the less.

A reader from Houston, TX , November 25, 1998

<p>
A wonderful, timeless story of family, adventure and home I can remember
Captain Kangaroo reading this book on his TV show and that was probably 30
years ago. A very delightful book which allows children to understand
responsiblity, adventure, family and home. The story is simple and
uncluttered, a small duck who decides to avoid the punishment due the last
duck to board the boat each night - a whack on the back, by hiding and not
boarding with the rest of the ducks.

<p>
Ping has his adventure and returns to the boat and his family, wiser yet
innocent. Great story to share with your children.

<p> I grew up on Ping and I love it still. I'm 21 now and buying it for
every friend with a kid. Its clean, its fun, and its just great.
