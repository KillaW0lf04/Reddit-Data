</p><p> Dave, for IP:

</p><p>I'm a long-time IP list reader and also Principal Architect for Skype, and
I'd like to address a few of the things below...

</p><p>*Ridgely Evers* wrote:

</p><p>John,

</p><p>That's a fine distinction; the fact is that the management of Skype -- even
when they were owned by eBay -- told the US Government to stick it, and got
away with it.

</p><p>I'm obviously not in a position to comment on what Skype can and cannot log
or intercept, nor how and when that data (if any) is passed on to third
parties. Microsoft has made statements about this aspect already.

</p><p>The very architecture of Skype made that relatively easy to do.  From its
inception all communications were strongly encrypted.  In addition, it was
peer-to-peer, making it nearly impossible to wiretap.

</p><p>As a consequence, people who were concerned about privacy -- including many
of us in the security industry -- used Skype for secure communications.

</p><p>Both eBay and Silverlake maintained this architecture, as well as the
Luxembourg HQ.

</p><p>Since being acquired by Microsoft, however, the service has been
re-architected to run through MSFT-owned servers, rendering encryption
functionally meaningless and making it just as easy as POTS to monitor.

</p><p>None of this -- neither the $7.5B acquisition itself, nor the decision to
move to a datacenter model -- make strategic or business sense for
Microsoft as far as I can tell.

</p><p>It's not the first really dumb thing they've done, but it makes me
suspicious, especially in light of recent news.

</p><p>Ok, so I take issue with it being "really dumb", and I'd like to explain
why:

</p><p>First is actually a more subtle issue... the Skype peer-to-peer network
architecture elected certain nodes to be "supernodes", to help maintain the
index of peers as well as handle parts of the NAT/firewall traversal for
other peers. This election algorithm chose only machines with open Internet
connectivity, substantial uptime, and which were running the latest version
of our peer-to-peer code. The last bit unfortunately meant that most of the
time, the election winners were a monoculture of Windows desktop machines
running the latest Windows Skype client. This proved to be a problem when
not once, but twice a global Skype network outage was caused by a crashing
bug in that client... bootstrapping the network back into existence
afterwards was painful and lengthy, and that is in part why Skype has
switched to server-based "dedicated supernodes"... nodes that we control,
can handle orders of magnitudes more clients per host, are in protected
data centers and up all the time, and running code that is less complex
that the entire client code base. (And this conversion started well before
the Microsoft acquisition was even announced, during the Silverlake era.)

</p><p>The second is really what is driving Skype to move not just the supernodes
but actually many other parts of our calling and messaging infrastructure
"to the cloud", and that is the amazing growth of mobile and tablet
computing. The Skype peer-to-peer network, and many of its functions (such
as instant messaging) was built for a world where almost every machine is
powered by a wall socket, plugged into broadband Internet, and on for many
hours a day.

</p><p>Over the past few years, the number of Skype users who are using Skype from
iOS-based phones and tablets, Android-based phones and tablets, Windows
Phone-based phones, and Windows RT tablet devices has gone from a tiny
percentage to a significant fraction of our user base. And these devices
are a lot different: they're running on battery, sometimes on WiFi but
often on expensive (both in money and battery) 2G or 3G data networks, and
essentially "off" most of the time. On iOS devices, applications are killed
and evicted from memory when they attempt to do too much background
processing or use too much memory. On Windows RT and Windows 8 Modern
applications, when the application is not in the foreground we only get a
few seconds of CPU execution time every 15 minutes and again, strict memory
limitations if we want to stay loaded. And when the Skype application is
unloaded, it can no longer receive incoming calls or IMs, rendering it a
lot less useful.

</p><p>If you've tried to use Skype on a mobile device, especially if you have a
lot of contacts or a lot of IM conversations, you'll discover that it
rapidly becomes a battery-powered hand warmer, and drains the battery
faster that probably any other well-known application out there. And this
is because it, until recently, was participating as a full node on our
peer-to-peer network... exchanging packets regularly (over your 3G radio,
most likely) with every single one of your contacts to keep presence status
updated, exchanging packets with everyone in every IM conversation to keep
those conversations synchronized, etc.

</p><p>And you probably also have started to notice things like missed IM
delivery, as the peer-to-peer delivery algorithm requires that both the
sender and the receiver be running at the same time in order to deliver a
message... not a problem with two broadband-attached always-on PCs, but
rare if you're both on Windows Phone or Windows RT tablets that only run
that algorithm when the application is in the foreground or for 3-5 seconds
after it is backgrounded.

</p><p>How do we solve that for our users? Servers. Lots of them, and more and
more often in the Windows Azure cloud infrastructure. In the case of
instant messaging, we have merged the Skype and Windows Messenger message
delivery backend services, and this now gets you delivery of messages even
when the recipient is offline, and other nice features like spam filtering
and malicious URL removal. For calling, we have the dedicated supernodes
already, and additional services to help calls succeed when the receiving
client is asleep and needs a push notification to wake up. And over time
you will see more and more services move to the Skype cloud, offloading
memory and CPU requirements from the mobile devices everyone wants to enjoy
to their fullest and with maximum battery life.

</p><p>Making this transition has been difficult and taken the hard work of
hundreds of developers, especially to make it as seamless as possible for
users who don't particularly care how we get it done or that we are
changing it... but I would say that it makes strategic and business sense
to be doing, otherwise we wouldn't bother, and I hope the above at least
partially explains why I think that.
