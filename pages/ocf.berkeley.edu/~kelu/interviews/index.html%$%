    <h1>Notes from a job seeking Software Developer</h1>

    When I first started, I could barely reverse a string.
    I was very pathetic.
    But with the help of my friends and coworkers I passed 9 out of 10 screening interviews (only failed the first one)
    and received a handful of amazing offers within three weeks.

    By sharing their collective wisdom and my personal experience, I hope that you can acheieve even greater success.
    
    And people were always curious about the questions. 
    I am posting all of the questions on the web so I don't have to repeat myself.

    Furthermore, I am bad at writing and have no website building experience. This is a way to practice both.

    Without my friends I wouldn't have <s>passed</s> gotten any interviews in the first place. In no particular order, I would like to thank:
    Darene, Jeff, Danny, Brian, Megha, Chinese Mark, German Mark,
    Sameer, Alex, Andrew, Marcus, Roger, Rich, Shahaf, Ravi, David, Robert,
    BJ, Davut, Lei, Hung, Joel, Aish, Thomas, Makarand,
    Ravi, Ashok, Mike, Mihir, Vu, Pavan, Zoltan.
    And a big thank you to all recruiters, 
    interviewers, and hiring managers for giving me a chance.
    <br /><br />
    Lastly, without my loving girlfriend Anny, I would have given up a long time ago.
