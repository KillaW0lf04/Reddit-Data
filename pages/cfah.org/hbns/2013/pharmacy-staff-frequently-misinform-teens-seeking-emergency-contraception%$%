	</div><p>Despite the fact that emergency contraception, also known as the morning-after pill, has been available since 2003, many teens still face barriers to obtaining the medication, a safe and effective way to prevent up to 74 percent of pregnancies following the failure of birth control or after unprotected sex.</p>

<p>A new study in the <em>Journal of Adolescent Health</em> finds that pharmacy staff frequently give teens misleading or incorrect information about emergency contraception that may prevent them from getting the medication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was having lots of teenagers telling me weird things about emergency contraception prescriptions,&rdquo; says lead study author Tracey Wilkinson, M.D., a pediatrician at the Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Los Angeles. She says that pharmacies might refuse to fill a prescription, confiscate a written prescription or even deny that an electronic prescription had been sent.</p>

<p>This led Wilkinson to investigate just what was happening at pharmacies when teens tried to purchase emergency contraception. Female researchers, posing as 17-year-old teens, called over 940 pharmacies in Nashville, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Austin, and Portland, Oregon and asked pharmacy staff basic questions about emergency contraception, including its availability, age requirements and confidentiality.</p>

<p>At the time of the study, the emergency contraception brand Plan B One Step was legally available to any person 17 years of age or older without a prescription, but was kept behind the pharmacy counter for purchase with a photo ID. Other brands of emergency contraception, including a generic form, were available by prescription for all teens and women.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About 20 percent of the pharmacy staff said that, because the callers identified themselves as teens, the callers couldn&rsquo;t get [emergency contraception] at all. That&rsquo;s completely incorrect,&rdquo; says Wilkinson. &ldquo;Of the remaining 80 percent of respondents, about half of them got the exact age requirement correct and half of them did not.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the study found that pharmacy staff often cited ethical reasons, such as institutional policies and personal religious beliefs, for not stocking or dispensing emergency contraception. Pharmacy staff often inaccurately told callers a parent or legal guardian would need to accompany the teen to pick up the medication, or that an older friend or boyfriend couldn&rsquo;t buy the prescription for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The federal laws governing the dispensing of emergency contraception have changed since the study was published&mdash;and have become even more confusing, says Wilkinson. As of July 2013, Plan B One Step is now legally available over the counter to anyone of any age, and no photo ID is necessary. Other brands are either available to teens 17 or older at the pharmacy counter without a prescription, or to teens of any age with a prescription. One brand is available only by prescription, regardless of age.</p>

<p>Cora Collette Breuner, M.D., a pediatrician and member of the Committee for Adolescents of the American Academy of Pediatrics says, &ldquo;Every time I go into a pharmacy, I see if Plan B is there without age restriction. And half of the time&mdash;or maybe even 80 percent of the time&mdash;it&rsquo;s not. That&rsquo;s against the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Breuner says that one of the best ways for teens to avoid problems at pharmacies is to get an advance prescription for the generic form of emergency contraception from their pediatrician or clinic and get it filled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wilkinson echoes this advice: &ldquo;I try to emphasize that teens should have emergency contraception at home, just like they have Tylenol for a headache&mdash;don&rsquo;t wait until you need it to try and go get it.&rdquo;</p>

You cannot say that a law saying they are not allowed to have an age restriction on Plan B is un-American. If anything putting an age restriction on it is un-American. You wouldn't see any pharmacy put an age restriction on condoms, or tampons or candy bars, or deodorant. If their is no age restriction then their is no age restriction.  </td></tr></table><br /><table border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:arial; font-size:12px; border:1px #C0C0C0 solid; background-color:#f6f6f6"><tr><td><strong>More Original says</strong><br />December 22, 2013 at 9:07 PM<br /><br />Original, how stupid can you be. There is no such thing as absolute freedom. How about the *freedom* for a person to have access to the medication they want? Which freedom is more important, that of a citizen, or that of a company? Regardless, what you are doing is further justifying the government providing health services, so that everyone has the freedom to have access to the medicine they want, you know, freedom and all. And it is unfortunately that there are areas where if one pharmacy doesn't carry something, there isn't another one nearby. It's a limitation of capitalism, which often needs to be countered by a democratic government stepping in to fill the gaps.

The article sites one "study" and one physician's anecdotal "experience". In defense of the pharmacy profession (of which I am a member), there are currently no laws that mandate that pharmacies carry or dispense Plan B or other behind the counter emergency contraceptives. In addition, calling a pharmacy and speaking to staff members doesn't mean you're speaking with a pharmacist, or even a technician but rather an untrained cashier. I personally don't believe that my own moral opinions should bias my practice but I realize other pharmacists feel differently. With that said, it is very difficult to hand out Plan B like condoms. It makes me nervous when I CAN'T counsel the patient on the proper use because her partner comes in for the medication. The thoughts that go through my mind are, "was this consensual? Is she okay? Who is this guy? What if it's child abuse?" I mean seriously plan b and condoms are NOTHING alike. There are side effects of taking plan b. Unfortunately some people use it as their only form of birth control, which means they aren't trying to prevent sexually transmitted diseases - I'd like to talk to these people and see if I could help. Too often pharmacists are labeled as obstructionists when in reality we're just trying to help the patient.<br />Yes, I know pharmacists that for moral reasons do not dispense emergency contraception, but most pharmacies in my state (TN) have a policy regarding this that states we have to post where the nearest pharmacy is that does carry plan B. I would much rather someone take plan b then end up a teen mom or in a position where they feel abortion is their only option and I would say in my experience this is how the majority of pharmacists practice as well. Talk to your pharmacist. We'd love to hear from you.</td></tr></table><br /><table border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:arial; font-size:12px; border:1px #C0C0C0 solid; background-color:#f6f6f6"><tr><td><strong>Ross says</strong><br />December 22, 2013 at 11:40 PM<br /><br />I agree with Sarah.

If the doctor cited in the article is upset about the outcome of her study, she should use that information and help local pharmacies to increase access to emergency contraception.  I am sure there is at least one local independent pharmacy who would love to help their patients in this way.</td></tr></table><br /><table border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:arial; font-size:12px; border:1px #C0C0C0 solid; background-color:#f6f6f6"><tr><td><strong>loveslife says</strong><br />December 22, 2013 at 11:42 PM<br /><br />same thing they do with pain medicine.

If the pharmacists don't want to accept that they do not have their personal freedom because they were granted this monopoly, the pharmacist is using Government restrictions to infringe on the buyer's individual freedom.

If you work in the health care field, you would know that a surprisingly large number of patients have misconceptions about medications and often misuses them without realizing.<br />They are also making the point that it's not illegal to not stock Emergency Contraception (EC) in it's inventory, especially if it's is OTC (over the counter) status. It's like saying it's illegal if a pharmacy doesn't feel like selling Tylenol or aspirin (also OTC status.) You can't find Tylenol here, go elsewhere that has it. Even though some pharmacies don't stock EC, a lot of others do. Get it there. Pharmacists' job aren't to hand out birth control like candy. They are there to prevent medication errors, catch doctors' mistakes (hey, we're all human!) and to properly counsel patients on correctly and safely using prescription medication. So just because they are hesitant to dispense EC or PREFERS (not mandate) and feels better that patients get educated, doesn't mean they should go "get a different job."<br /><br />And to Sarah's defense: Yes, the patient has rights and privacy, but that's not even the issue here. If EC is now over-the-counter, the "buyer" or the "buyer's representative" no longer needs to go through a doctor anymore to obtain it. So them already being counseled by their doctors is pure assumption. You can't even assume that to be true even in cases where patients are prescribed medication by doctors. Doctors are often very busy and may not have time to counsel or may have left something important out by mistake.</td></tr></table><br />
