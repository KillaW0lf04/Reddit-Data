        <h4><a href="./blog/2014/06/june-2014-lab-meeting-summary.html">Summary of June 2014 Lab Meeting</a></h4>
<small>By Greg Wilson / <a href="./blog/2014/06/june-2014-lab-meeting-summary.html">2014-06-27</a> </small>
<p>
    <p>   At our monthly lab meeting yesterday (June 26),   we discussed a wide range of topics (though only about half as much as was on the agenda).   Details notes and votes are below; the key points are: </p> <ol>   <li>     We would like to do what we can to help the careers of people who volunteer for Software Carpentry.     In particular,     we'd like to find a way to highlight people who have taught lots of bootcamps,     contributed lots of material,     or both,     <em>without</em> discouraging people who haven't,     or getting into a situation in which bootcamp hosts ask,     "Why aren't you sending your most experienced people to us?"     We've opened <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/issues/575">a GitHub issue</a>     for people who'd like to discuss this topic,     and we'd be grateful if you could share experiences with other systems     and suggestions about what we could do.   </li>   <li>     We will have a meeting on Thursday, July 3 to discuss plans for the July 22-23 sprint.     The time and connection details will be posted here on July 2.   </li>   <li>     People were either neutral or in favor of switching to Python 3.     There was concern about compatibility,     but it seems that most scientific packages are now Py3-compatible     (and that there are some that only work with Py3, and not with Py2).     In practice, this will mean:     <ul>       <li>changing what people have on their machine when they leave the bootcamp, and</li>       <li>minor modifications to our lessons (e.g., <code>print</code> as a function).</li>     </ul>   </li>   <li>     By default,     Mercurial launches a GUI diff/merge tool when there's a conflict rather than displaying a textual diff.     Novices seem to find side-by-side merge easier to work with,     which raises the question:     should we use a graphical tool for diff and merge when teaching Git as well?     Again,     most people were either neutral or in favor,     subject to ease of installation.     We'll try this at a couple of workshops in the coming months and report back.   </li>   <li>     Should we install Matt Davis's <code>ipythonblocks</code> module by default?     Nobody was opposed,     but it turned out that only a handful of people actually use it in teaching.     We'll poll our instructors to find out more about usage before making a final decision.   </li>   <li>     In order to make it easy for people who want to teach regular expressions to do so,     we'll integrate the software that runs <a href="http://regexpal.com">regexpal.com</a>     (which ironically is down at the time of this writing)     into the <code>bc</code> repo     so that instructors can create a page in their bootcamp site where learners can play around.   </li>   <li>     Jonah Duckles has created <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/pull/415">a pull request</a>     that would change the way installation instructions are managed.     Instead of editing <code>_includes/setup.html</code>,     instructors would add a list of topics to the header of <code>index.html</code>     that Jekyll's templating logic would use to control what is and isn't displayed.     Most people were in favor,     so we'll merge this once the PR is finished.   </li>   <li>     Many people are still not happy with the way our lesson materials are organized,     or with what pre-requisite knowledge we actually expect.     We will organize a meeting for next Thursday (July 3) to talk about options,     then open a discussion issue on GitHub if we can come up with concrete alternatives.   </li>   <li>     Raniere Silva has been working over the last few weeks to generate EPUB and PDF from our materials.     The goal is to allow anyone who wants to produce book-form notes to do so     for use in a regular class,     to give to learners after a bootcamp,     or for self-study.     He's been making good progress,     but there are still lots of small problems (particularly with the PDF).     We'll be hacking on this at the sprint.   </li> </ol>

<h4><a href="./blog/2014/06/iuse-proposal-rejected.html">Our IUSE Proposal Was Rejected</a></h4>
<small>By Greg Wilson / <a href="./blog/2014/06/iuse-proposal-rejected.html">2014-06-27</a> </small>
<p>
    <p>   We got word a few days ago that our proposal to the   NSF's <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504976">Improving   Undergraduate STEM Education</a> program had been rejected.   The panel summary agreed that software training is a good idea,   but were not convinced about our plans to shift from training grad students to undergrads.    In particular,   they were not convinced that Unix-based workshops would be best for undergrads,   and felt that not being embedded in the regular curriculum was a weakness.   These are fair criticisms: </p> <ol>   <li>     Most undergraduates only use GUIs and cannot navigate the terminal to save their lives.     The perception that Software Carpentry is Unix-specific therefore hurt the proposal,     and showed that we didn't clearly explain our focus on underlying concepts.   </li>   <li>     The fact that we wouldn't be part of the regular curriculum is more difficult to address.     The fact is,     it really <em>is</em> hard to get undergrads to do things that interfere with earning grades,     just as it's often hard to get grad students to do anything that doesn't immediately lead to a publication.     Some of their concern about impact also seemed to be due to us concentrating on REU students,     a self-selected bunch that already are motivated.   </li> </ol> <p>   At the same time,   though,   the panel did not connect the results from years of Software Carpentry workshops   and the expected impact of this effort.   This indicates that the proposal did not effectively communicate how well our experience to date   has laid the groundwork for efforts like this. </p> <p>   We're obviously disappointed by this rejection,   but we've some useful lessons,   and we hope that they will inspire others to put forward proposals of their own. </p>

<h4><a href="./blog/2014/06/help-us-build-an-admin-tool-for-bootcamps.html">Help Us Build an Admin Tool for Bootcamps</a></h4>
<small>By Greg Wilson / <a href="./blog/2014/06/help-us-build-an-admin-tool-for-bootcamps.html">2014-06-20</a> </small>
<p>
    <p>   It takes a lot of work behind the scenes to match instructors to bootcamps,   keep track of who taught (or learned) where,   and manage our mailing lists.   Our current cobbled-together tools are at their breaking point,   so <a href="http://github.com/toolness/">Atul Varma</a>,   a developer at Mozilla,   put together a simple browser-on-the-desktop app   to help administrators find instructors based on geography and skills.   We'd like many other features&mdash;in particular,   bulk upload of attendance lists from bootcamps&mdash;so if you would like to help us out,   please <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/admintool/">clone this repository</a>   and send us fixes and additions. </p> <p>   Many thanks to Atul for getting us started&mdash;we're looking forward to <em>not</em> grepping for instructors any more :-). </p>
