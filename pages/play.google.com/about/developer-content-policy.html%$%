        Google Play Developer Program Policies
      </h2>
      <p>
        The policies listed below play an important role in maintaining a positive experience for
        everyone using Google Play. Defined terms used here have the same meaning as in the
        <a href="http://www.android.com/us/developer-distribution-agreement.html">Developer
        Distribution Agreement</a>. Be sure to check back from time to time, as these policies may
        change.
      </p><strong>Content Policies</strong><br>
      <p id="content-policy">
        Our content policies apply to any content your app displays or links to, including any ads
        it shows to users and any user-generated content it hosts or links to. Further, they apply
        to any content from your developer account which is publicly displayed in Google Play,
        including your developer name and the landing page of your listed developer website. In
        addition to complying with these policies, the content of your app must be rated in
        accordance with our <a href=
        "http://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/bin/answer.py?answer=188189">Content
        Rating Guidelines</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li id="sexual-content">
          <strong>Sexually Explicit Material:</strong> Apps that contain or promote pornography are
          prohibited; this includes sexually explicit or erotic content, icons, titles, or
          descriptions. Google has a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse imagery. If
          we become aware of content with child sexual abuse imagery, we will report it to the
          appropriate authorities and delete the Google Accounts of those involved with the
          distribution.
        </li>
        <li id="violence-bullying">
          <strong>Violence and Bullying:</strong> Depictions of gratuitous violence are not
          allowed. Apps should not contain materials that threaten, harass or bully other users.
        </li>
        <li id="hate-speech">
          <strong>Hate Speech:</strong> We don't allow content advocating against groups of people
          based on their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status,
          or sexual orientation/gender identity.
        </li>
        <li id="impersonation">
          <strong>Impersonation or Deceptive Behavior:</strong> Don't pretend to be someone else,
          and don't represent that your app is authorized by or produced by another company or
          organization if that is not the case. Products or the ads they contain also must not
          mimic functionality or warnings from the operating system or other apps. Products must
          not contain false or misleading information in any content, title, icon, description, or
          screenshots. Developers must not divert users or provide links to any other site that
          mimics or passes itself off as another app or service. Apps must not have names or icons
          that appear confusingly similar to existing products, or to apps supplied with the device
          (such as Camera, Gallery or Messaging).
        </li>
        <li id="IP">
          <strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Donât infringe on the intellectual property
          rights of others, (including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, and other
          proprietary rights), or encourage or induce infringement of intellectual property rights.
          We will respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. For more information

          non-public contacts, or any other information that is not publicly accessible.

          <strong>Gambling:</strong> We donât allow content or services that facilitate online

            </li>
            <li>Apps that collect information (such as the user's location or behavior) without the
            user's knowledge (spyware) are prohibited.
            </li>
            <li>Malicious scripts and password phishing scams are also prohibited on Google Play,

            outside of Google Play.
            </li>
            <li>An app downloaded from Google Play may not modify, replace or update its own APK

            not make changes to the userâs device outside of the app without the userâs knowledge
            and consent.
            </li>
            <li>This includes behavior such as replacing or reordering the default presentation of
            apps, widgets, or the settings on the device. If an app makes such changes with the
            userâs knowledge and consent, it must be clear to the user which app has made the
            change and the user must be able to reverse the change easily, or by uninstalling the
            app altogether.
            </li>
            <li>Apps and their ads must not modify or add browser settings or bookmarks, add
            homescreen shortcuts, or icons on the userâs device as a service to third parties or
            for advertising purposes.
            </li>
            <li>Apps and their ads must not display advertisements through system level
            notifications on the userâs device, unless the notifications derive from an integral
            feature provided by the installed app (e.g., an airline app that notifies users of
            special deals, or a game that notifies users of in-game promotions).
            </li>
            <li>Apps must not encourage, incentivize, or mislead users into removing or disabling
            third-party apps except as part of a security service provided by the app.
            </li>
          </ul>

      </ul>
      <p id="network-terms">
        <strong>Network Usage and Terms</strong><br>
        Apps must not create unpredictable network usage that has an adverse impact on a user's
        service charges or an Authorized Carrier's network. Apps also may not knowingly violate an
        Authorized Carrier's terms of service for allowed usage or any Google terms of service.

        </li>
        <li>Developers must not attempt to change the placement of any Product in the Store, or
        manipulate any product ratings or reviews by unauthorized means such as fraudulent
        installs, paid or fake reviews or ratings, or by offering incentives to rate products.
        </li>
        <li>Apps that are created by an automated tool or wizard service must not be submitted to
        Google Play by the operator of that service on behalf of other persons.
        </li>
        <li>Do not post an app where the primary functionality is to:

            <li>Provide a webview of a website not owned or administered by you (unless you have

        <strong>App Promotion</strong><br>
        Apps published on Google Play may not directly or indirectly engage in or benefit from the

      <ul>
        <li>Promotion via deceptive ads on websites, apps or other properties, including simulated
        system, service, or app notifications or alerts.

        <li>Unsolicited promotion via SMS services.
        </li>
      </ul>

        and updates of the relevant subscription content (if any) for the remainder of the billing
        period, regardless of the cancellation.<br>
        You (as the content or access provider) may implement a more flexible refund policy with

            take care to use advertising which does not violate the Developer Terms.

            <strong>Usage of Android advertising ID</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Google Play Services version 4.0 introduced new APIs and an ID for use by advertising
            and analytics providers. Terms for the use of these APIs and ID are below.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Usage</strong>. The <a href=
              "http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/id.html">Android advertising
              identifier</a> must only be used for advertising and user analytics. The status of
              the âOpt out of Interest-based Advertisingâ setting must be verified on each access
              of the ID.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Association with personally-identifiable information or other
              identifiers</strong>. The advertising identifier must not be connected to
              personally-identifiable information or associated with any persistent device
              identifier (for example: SSAID, MAC address, IMEI, etc.,) without the explicit
              consent of the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Respecting users' selections</strong>. Upon reset, a new advertising
              identifier must not be connected to a previous advertising identifier or data derived
              from a previous advertising identifier without the explicit consent of the user.
              Furthermore, you must abide by a userâs âopt out of interest-based advertisingâ
              setting. If a user has enabled this setting, you may not use the advertising
              identifier for creating user profiles for advertising purposes or for targeting users
              with interest-based advertising. Allowed activities include contextual advertising,
              frequency capping, conversion tracking, reporting and security and fraud detection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transparency to users</strong>. The collection and use of the advertising
              identifier and commitment to these terms must be disclosed to users in a legally
              adequate privacy notification.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Abiding by the terms of use</strong>. The advertising identifier may only be
              used in accordance with these terms, including by any party that you may share it
              with in the course of your business. Beginning August 1st 2014, all updates and new
              apps uploaded to the Play Store must use the advertising ID (when available on a
              device) in lieu of any other device identifiers for any advertising purposes.
