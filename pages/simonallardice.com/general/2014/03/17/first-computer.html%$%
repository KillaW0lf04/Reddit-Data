                <h2>Getting Started, circa 1983</h2>
<p class="meta">17 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Like most folks who started programming in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s, I began on mainframes. It was <em>years</em> before I programmed a desktop computer. </p>

<p>And while I strive to avoid <em>damn-kids-get-off-my-lawn</em> graybeard ramblings, I&#39;ll sometimes get this question from a brash young whippersnapper trying to understand what pre-PC era programming was like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back in your first programming job, what kind of computer was on your desk?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my first programming job, I didn&#39;t <em>have</em> a computer on my desk. </p>

<p>My desk - like those of my co-workers - was device free. The nearest we had to a personal computing device was an LCD calculator.</p>

<p>Not only didn&#39;t I have a computer on my desk, there wasn&#39;t one in the entire office, or even in the same building. We were programming a mainframe that was about five miles along the road.</p>

<p>Instead, imagine a stack of <em>these</em> on my desk:</p>

<p><img src="http://simonallardice.com/assets/codingsheet.jpg" alt="COBOL Coding sheet"></p>

<p>This is an IBM coding sheet, for COBOL. We had them for other languages, too: Pascal, Assembly language, Fortran.</p>

<p>You&#39;d use these to hand-write your computer programs. <strong>In pencil.</strong> </p>

<p>Because <strong>this</strong> was the dizzying heights of &quot;undo&quot; technology:</p>

<p><img src="http://simonallardice.com/assets/pencil.png" alt="pencil eraser"></p>

<p>And when you were finished handwriting a section of code - perhaps a full program, perhaps a subroutine - you&#39;d gather these sheets together (carefully numbered in sequence, of course) and send them along to the folks in the data entry department. </p>

<p><strong>They&#39;d</strong> type it in. </p>

<p>And the next day you&#39;d get a report to find out if it compiled or not.</p>

<p>Let me say that again: <strong>the next <em>day</em> you could find out if your code compiled or not.</strong> </p>

<p>If you&#39;d made even a simple typo - say, a missing period, or something that looked more like a colon than a semicolon - it&#39;d take at least another 24 hours to get a fix in and turn it around.</p>

<p>This method, as you might imagine, requires a somewhat higher level of attentiveness to writing code than the way most of us work now. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t want to work like this again, but I&#39;m glad I <em>have</em> worked like this.</p>

<p>And though it may seem primitive now, several of the programmers I worked with at the time viewed that state of affairs as programmer-friendly, if indeed not simplistic. </p>

<p>They&#39;d been used to working with punch cards, something I only ever did a handful of times.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit that even at the time (early 80&#39;s) this was a little - though not much - behind the times. I was working for the British Government, not some new-fangled highly-funded tech company. You use what you can get. </p>

<p>A year or two into this, we <em>were</em> finally upgraded. Amidst much rejoicing, we were provided a handful of IBM 3270 dumb terminals - monochrome devices, with the classic IBM Model M clicky keyboard. </p>

<p>Imagine the sensation - type <em>your own</em> code in? Compile a program <em>yourself</em>? How marvelous! What an age we lived in!</p>
