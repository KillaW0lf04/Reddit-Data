<h1>Why I (A/L)GPL</h1>

<p>In the Python world the GPL is frequently frowned on, with most people
preferring to use a more permissive license such as BSD, MIT, or
<a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.2/license/">Pythonâs</a>.
Itâs
understandable then when people get angry because Iâve licensed
<a href="http://lamsonproject.org/">Lamson</a> under the GPL. Many people just hate
the
license, since they feel it goes contrary to the spirit of Python.</p>

<p>However, Iâd like to explain why <strong>I</strong> use the GPL after decades of
writing open
source software and after a couple of âsuccessfulâ projects. These are
my
reasons for using it, and only apply to me and what I want to do with
my
software from now on. You are free to your own opinions and choices,
and
I hope youâll respect mine.</p>

<h2>Itâs The Authorâs Right</h2>

<p>I believe that whatever the author wants to do with his or her works is
their
right. They wrote it, despite everyone telling them it wouldnât work.
They
slaved over it rather than going out with friends. They debugged it, and
wrote
documentation for it so everyone else could use it. They may have even
spent a
part of their time promoting it and helping people with it. All for
free, and
for whatever reason they choose.</p>

<p>When you rip on a project or someone for their choice of license you are
being
<strong>gigantic</strong> jerk. They worked on it, not you. At a minimum youâre
insulting
someoneâs belief in open source and free software, and how they feel it
should
progress in our culture.</p>

<p>At the worst you are being ungrateful turds because someone is giving
you a
piece of software, but you insult their work not on its technical
merits, but
on a license file you disagree with.</p>

<p>I really donât care what license people use on their software, itâs
<strong>their</strong>
software and bitching at them for the license they choose is offensive.
They
wrote it, put their blood and sweat into it, and you should be glad that
you
get the privilege of even seeing it.</p>

<h3>Thatâs my first reason I use the GPL:</h3>

<p>Because I want to, and if you disagree with it then donât use my
software.
Itâs as simple as that.</p>

<h2>I Donât Want To Be Ignored Again</h2>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">Mongrel</a> and then gave it away,
on the
hopes that it would help a bunch of other people, and that giving it
away would
come back to me in some way. Maybe a job, or some respect, or hell maybe
my
own company doing more software like it.</p>

<p>Mongrel was a wild success, and lots and lots of companies are making
lots and
lots of money off it. It not only powered Rails, but nearly every Ruby
web
framework, other Ruby web servers, and was even ported to other
languages.
Mongrel is and was a super project and Iâm really proud of it.</p>

<p>Let me give you an idea of how advanced Mongrel was. Remember the ânewâ
attack
on Apache called <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/">Slowloris</a> that was
recently
released? I actually predicted that attack, and wrote Mongrel so that it
was
resistant (as much as Ruby could let me). I called it the âtrickle
attackâ and
even demonstrated it. That was in 2004. <strong>Five</strong> years ago. I even added
it as
an attack to <a href="http://rfuzz.rubyforge.org/">RFuzz</a> in 2005.</p>

<p>Sadly, none of Mongrelâs success mattered for me. Even though everyone
was
using my software, the vast majority of firms using Mongrel were
startups. The
last thing a startup wants to admit is that they donât own their
intellectual
property. They want everyone, especially the VCs and investors, to
believe
that theyâre all geniuses who âinnovatedâ everything they run.</p>

<p>When I looked around, companies had no problem admitting they used Ruby
on
Rails, hell that probably got them their funding. What I didnât see was
them
saying they used anything else, which meant that when I would try to get
work,
it was impossible for me to explain the magnitude of Mongrelâs impact.
To them
it was just some simple web server that their system administrator had
to use,
âRoRâ was the real money maker.</p>

<h3>This is my second reason I use the GPL:</h3>

<p>After Mongrel I almost <strong>need</strong> companies to have to admit they use my
software.
I would actually rather nobody use my software than be in a situation
where
everyone is using my gear and nobody is admitting it.</p>

<p>Or worse, everyone is using it, and at the same time saying I canât
code.</p>

<h2>Venture Capital Changed The Industry</h2>

<p>There has been a change in the software industry since about 2000. Iâd
put the
mark at around Googleâs IPO actually, but I canât say exactly when. What
I can
say is that the current way technology companies are grown promotes an
attitude
of exploiting open source rather than contributing.</p>

<p>I canât really blame these companies though, they are designed to flip.
A VC
backed firm is almost <strong>always</strong> going to be setup for a short-term gain
in the
hopes of bringing a handsome return on investment later. For a VC,
expecting a
payout in 20 years is unheard of, especially if you plan on doing it
without an
IPO and stock options for everyone involved.</p>

<p>For a VC backed firm it is entirely about ever increasing revenues to
give the
illusion of growth so that shareholders will invest and drive the price
of a
stock as high as possible. It is <strong>not</strong> in their best interest to
<strong>not</strong> do an
IPO. They want money now, as much of it as possible, and they arenât
interested in good technology investments or people.</p>

<p>What they want is tons of free technology they can hide from investors.
They
want that technology all run by people who didnât write any of the
software so
that these employees canât claim ownership later.</p>

<p>This nearsighted management, combined with limited funding at the start,
means
that these companies exploit open source. They will use it, make their
money,
and then run off when theyâre done. Which, actually, is totally
alright,
because thatâs just how things are, and honestly if youâre a company
looking to
make money that way, then thatâs what you should do.</p>

<p>However, the unwritten contract between firms and open source developers
is now
gone. I have no reason to give them unrestricted use of my software
since they
are only interested in turning my software into a hot IPO 2â5 years from
now.</p>

<h3>This is my third reason I use the GPL:</h3>

<p>Technology firms are now designed to be created and destroy fast for
large VC
profits while keeping costs low. That means they have no economic
incentive to
give back, so I have no social incentive to âgiveâ them my software.</p>

<h2>Programmers Are Plagiarists</h2>

<p>Letâs not kid ourselves here, everyone has to eat and pay rent. For many
people,
their money needs are modest, and if you work on something, you
generally expect
that you get something out of it that helps with those needs. It might
not be
money. Maybe itâs respect or accolades, but you really are expecting
something
for your work.</p>

<p>Alright, then I find it bizarre when I run into a comment like this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://twitter.com/ericholscher/status/2595749451">ericholscher</a>
    @zedshaw Would be nice if the Django interface/code to Lamson was
    BSDâd. Really useful to use at work. REST interface works as well :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eric is a totally nice guy, so Iâm not slagging on him at all, but on
this
general attitude. âHey your software is awesome! Can I get it for free
so I
can use it at work and make money or please my boss? Thatâd rock! (for
me).â</p>

<p>Honestly, how many of you people who use open source tell your boss what
youâre
using? How many of you tell investors that your entire operation is
based on
something one guy wrote in a few months? How many of you out there go
to
management and say, âHey, you know thereâs this guy Zed who wrote the
software
Iâm using, why donât we hire him as a consultant?â</p>

<p>You donât. None of you. You take the software, and use it like Excalibur
to
slay your dragon and then take the credit for it. You donât give out
any
credit, and in fact, Iâve ran into a vast majority of you who constantly
try to
say that I canât code as a way of covering your ass.</p>

<p>Itâs now even more condoned and accepted that all you guys plagiarize
the works
you use. Just as the companies you work for need to have the illusion
of
âinnovationâ, you need to have the illusion of being smart. What this
leads to
is you lie, and steal anything you can get your hands on to claim as
your own.</p>

<p>Thatâs quite alright, but that means you broke the unwritten contract
between
open source/freesoftware advocates. As long as you give me credit and
promote
my works, Iâll give you my software. Since none of you do, that means I
have
no incentive to âgiveâ you my software in the same way I donât need to
abide
by the contract with the VC backed firm.</p>

<h3>This is my fourth reason for using the GPL:</h3>

<p>I use the GPL to keep you honest. You now <strong>have</strong> to tell your bosses
youâre using 
my gear. And it will scare the piss out of them. Good. Because I have a
solution
to that too.</p>

<h2>If Itâs Good, Pay For It</h2>

<p>I love working on <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/">Lamson</a> because doing
email
applications are so much more fun that web applications. When I sit down
to do
an email app it takes only one set of technologies and Iâm done. If I
want to
do a web application it involves design, and templates, and javascript,
and
databases, and endless streams of bullshit.</p>

<p>The other reason I love writing email software is <strong>nobody else does</strong>.
You guys
are all giant pansies, even with a project like Lamson youâre still all
afwaid
of big bad monsta SMTP. Hell, the day I said I might have âMail over
RESTâ you
guys about shit your pants. Yeah, âcause thatâll be <strong>way</strong> easier.</p>

<p>And I love giving Lamson away, because itâs a part of who I am. Itâs
that
perfect mix of showmanship, technical chops, marketing, and writing that
I love
and excel at. Even if I eventually go on to make tons of money building
things
with Lamson, Iâll always keep Lamson free to keep myself honest.</p>

<p>But, I am also writing my own software and projects with Lamson. Iâm
going to use
it to create as many badass awesome email services as I can. Some free,
some ad
supported, some for pay, but all using Lamson in some way to kick ass at
email.</p>

<p>Now, given that thereâs no incentive for a company to admit they use my
stuff, and
thereâs no incentive for a programmer to give me credit, ask yourself
this one
question:</p>

<p>Why the fuck wouldnât I charge people money who canât use the GPL?</p>

<p>I know, I know, many of you freesoftware diehards are thinking that
makes me 
a traitor, but think about it. You have the software, and itâs GPLed,
and
as long as youâre a rock solid open source project who releases their
code
you are free to use it and do what you want with it.</p>

<p>I love open source, but companies? Companies are going to have to pay
from now
on. Thatâs how economics works. If itâs good enough for you to use, why
then
itâs good enough for you to pay for it.</p>

<h3>My fifth reason for using the GPL:</h3>

<p>Iâll always be an open source developer, but quite frankly, weâre dying
off
because the companies who use our software do not give back. The irony
of the
situation is that, in order to improve my motivation to do open source,
I have
to charge for it.</p>

<p>I obviously wonât ever charge an open source project, since they are 
honoring the unwritten contract: If I give, you give.</p>

<p>But the days of quick-flip corporations and ingrate programmers making
money 
on my software are over. My new motto is:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Open source to open source, corporation to corporation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you do open source, youâre my hero and I support you. If youâre a
corporation,
letâs talk business.</p>

<h2>Finally, Value</h2>

<p>In closing, Iâd also like to give a small reason why I use the GPL:
perceived value.
When people can get something for free without having to think about it,
they perceive it
as worth less than even something they pay a single penny for. Itâs just
how 
people are, and thereâs not much you can do about it.</p>

<p>My final reason for using the GPL is I think my projects have value, and
I want 
people who use them to perceive that value in them. I think they are so
valuable
that Iâm willing to put a complex untested legal document down as my bet
to their
utility. If I wanted it easy I would simple BSD license it and everyone
would use it.</p>

<p>I want people to appreciate the work Iâve done and the value of what
Iâve made.</p>

<p>Not pass on by waving âsuckerâ as they drive their fancy cars.</p>
