<h1>Opera files complaint &mdash; an open letter to the Web community</h1>

<p>Over the years I have been an active participant in the ongoing
fight for open and interoperable Web standards. I have always opposed
those who would force proprietary technologies where open
alternatives, often superior, exist. From 1994 to 1999, I worked at
CERN and W3C to help make sure there were good specifications for the
Web. In 1999, I joined Opera to make sure there was at least one
browser that implemented those specifications correctly. We have
worked hard to do that. Unfortunately Microsoft's Internet Explorer,
the biggest browser of all, did not.

<p>Today we have taken a stand. Opera has <a
href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2007/12/13/">filed a
formal complaint</a> with the European Commission to force Microsoft
to support open Web standards in its Web browser, Internet Explorer.
We believe that Microsoft has harmed Web standards by refusing to
support them; Microsoft often participates in creating Web standards,
promoting them, and even promising to implement them. Despite their
talent, however, they refuse to support Web standards correctly. For
example, Internet Explorer is the only modern Web browser that <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid2">does not</a> support <a
href="http://www.webstandards.org/acid2">Acid2</a>.

<p>Opera has also requested that Microsoft frees Internet Explorer from
the Windows platform. We feel that they have used their market
dominating position to limit a genuine choice of browsers on the Web
for their own commercial gain.

<p>The time for action is now. The Web browser is the most important
application for most of us. Developers and designers are creating more
powerful Web sites and applications. But because Internet Explorer
doesn't implement open and fully-developed Web standards, the work is
hard and frustrating. Web designers are forced to spend time working
around IE bugs rather than doing what inspires them. We seek no money
from Microsoft. We would rather see Microsoft put their considerable
talent and resources to work for the Web community.

<p>To those of you who build and shape the sites and services we use
everyday &mdash; and who will create those in the future &mdash; I ask
for your support. You will be the ones who ultimately benefit by
having a Web that works seamlessly and effortlessly across devices,
browsers and is equally open to everyone. That new day is just over
the horizon, and by working together, we will awaken to that dawn.

Thank you.
