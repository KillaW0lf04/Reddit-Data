			<h1>How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries</h1>
			<p align="left">
	The lithium-ion battery works on ion movement between the positive and negative electrodes. In theory such a mechanism should work forever, but cycling, elevated temperature and aging decrease the performance over time. Since batteries are used in demanding environmental conditions, manufacturers take a conservative approach and specify the life of most Li-ion between 300 and 500 discharge/charge cycles.</p>
<p align="left">
	Counting cycles is not conclusive because a discharge may vary in depth and there are no clearly defined standards of what constitutes a cycle. Read more about&nbsp;<a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/discharge_methods">What Constitutes a Discharge Cycle?</a>.&nbsp; In lieu of cycle count, some batteries in industrial instruments are date-stamped, but this method is not reliable either because it ignores environmental conditions. A battery may fail within the allotted time due to heavy use or unfavorable temperature conditions, but most quality packs will last considerably longer than what the stamp indicates.</p>
<p align="left">
	The performance of a battery is measured in capacity, a leading health indicator. Internal resistance and self-discharge also play a role but with modern Li-ion these carry lower significance in predicting the end-of-battery-life. Figure 1 illustrates the capacity drop of 11 Li-polymer batteries that have been cycled at a Cadex laboratory. The 1500mAh pouch cells for smartphones were first charged at a current of 1500mA (1C) to 4.20V/cell and allowed to saturate to 0.05C (75mA) as part of the full charge procedure. The batteries were then discharged at 1500mA to 3.0V/cell, and the cycle was repeated.&nbsp;</p>

	Although a battery should deliver 100 percent capacity during the first year of service, it is common to see lower than specified capacities, and shelf life may have contributed to this loss. In addition, manufacturers tend to overrate their batteries; knowing that very few customers would complain. In our test, the expected capacity loss of Li-ion batteries was uniform over the 250 cycles and the batteries performed as expected.</p>
<p>
	Similar to a mechanical device that wears out faster with heavy use, so also does the depth of discharge (DoD) determine the cycle count. The shorter the discharge (low DoD), the longer the battery will last. If at all possible, avoid full discharges and charge the battery more often between uses. Partial discharge on Li-ion is fine; there is no memory and the battery does not need periodic full discharge cycles to prolong life, other than to calibrate the fuel gauge on a smart battery once in a while. Read more about <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/battery_calibration">Battery Calibration</a>.</p>
<p>
	Table 2 compares the number of discharge/charge cycles Li-ion can deliver at various DoD levels before the battery capacity drops to 70 percent. The number of discharge cycles depends on many conditions and includes charge voltage, temperature and load currents. Not all Li-ion systems behave the same.</p>

	Lithium-ion suffers from stress when exposed to heat, so does keeping a cell at a high charge voltage. A battery dwelling above 30&deg;C (86&deg;F) is considered <em>elevated temperature</em> and for most Li-ion, a voltage above 4.10V/cell is deemed as <em>high voltage</em>. Exposing the battery to high temperature and dwelling in a full state-of-charge for an extended time can be more stressful than cycling. Table 3 demonstrates capacity loss as a function of temperature and SoC.</p>

	Most Li-ions are charged to 4.20V/cell and every reduction of 0.10V/cell is said to double cycle life.&nbsp; For example, a lithium-ion cell charged to 4.20V/cell typically delivers 300&ndash;500 cycles. If charged to only 4.10V/cell, the life can be prolonged to 600&ndash;1,000 cycles; 4.00V/cell should deliver 1,200&ndash;2,000 and 3.90V/cell 2,400&ndash;4,000 cycles. Table 4 summarizes these results. The values are estimate and depend on the type of li-ion-ion battery.</p>

	For safety reasons, lithium-ion cannot exceed 4.20V/cell. While a higher voltage would boost capacity, over-voltage shortens service life and compromises safety. Figure 5 demonstrates cycle count as a function of charge voltage. At 4.35V, the cycle count is cut in half.</p>

	Chargers for cellular phones, laptops, tablets and digital cameras bring the Li-ion battery to 4.20V/cell. This allows maximum capacity, because the consumer wants nothing less than optimal runtime. Industry, on the other hand, is more concerned about longevity and may choose lower voltage thresholds. Satellites and electric vehicles are examples where longevity is more important than capacity.</p>
<p>
	Charging to 4.10V/cell the battery holds about 10 percent less capacity than going all the way to 4.20V. In terms of optimal longevity, a voltage limit of 3.92V/cell works best but the capacity would only be about half compared to a 4.20V/cell charge (3.92V/cell is said to eliminate all voltage-related stresses).</p>
<p>
	Besides selecting the best-suited voltage thresholds for a given application, Li-ion should not remain at the high-voltage ceiling of 4.20V/cell for an extended time. When fully charged, remove the battery and allow to voltage to revert to a more natural level like relaxing after exercise. Although a properly functioning Li-ion charger will terminate charge when the battery is full, some chargers apply a topping charge if the battery terminal voltage drops to a given level.

<h2>
	What the user can do</h2>
<p align="left">
	The author of this essay does not depend on the manufacturer&rsquo;s specifications alone but also listens to user comments. BatteryUniversity.comis an excellent sounding board to connect with the public and learn about reality. This approach might be unscientific, but it is genuine. When the critical mass speaks, the manufacturers listen. The voice of the multitude is in some ways stronger than laboratory tests performed in sheltered environments.</p>
<p>
	Tables 2, 3 and 4 look at cycle life as a function of discharge, temperature and charge level. A summary table should be added that also states the <em>Optimal Battery Energy Factor Over Life</em>. While this would help in selecting the optimal battery, battery makers are hesitant to release such a specification freely, and for good reason. A battery is in constant flux and capturing all of its data is exhaustive. A further criterion is price. Batteries can be built to perform better but this comes at a cost.</p>
<p align="left">
	Let&rsquo;s look at real-life situations and examine what stresses lithium-ion batteries encounter. Most packs last three to five years. Environmental conditions, and not cycling alone, are a key ingredient to longevity, and the worst situation is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures. This is the case when running a laptop off the power grid. Under these conditions, a battery will typically last for about two years, whether cycled or not. The pack does not die suddenly but will give lower runtimes with aging.</p>
<p align="left">
	Even more stressful is leaving a battery in a hot car, especially if exposed to the sun. When not in use, store the battery in a cool place. For long-term storage, manufacturers recommend a 40 percent charge. This allows for some self-discharge while still retaining sufficient charge to keep the protection circuit active. Finding the ideal state-of-charge is not easy; this would require a discharge with appropriate cut-off. Do not worry too much about the state-of-charge; a cool and dry place is more important than SoC. Read more about <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_store_batteries">How to Store Batteries</a>.</p>
<p align="left">
	Batteries are also exposed to elevated temperature when charging on wireless chargers. The energy transfer from a charging mat to a portable device is 70 to 80 percent and the remaining 20 to 30 percent is lost mostly in heat that is transferred to the battery through the mat. We keep in mind that the mat will cool down once the battery is fully charged. Read more about&nbsp;<a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_without_wires">Charging Without Wires</a>.</p>
<p align="left">
	Avoid charging a battery faster than 1C; a more moderate charge rate of 0.7C is preferred. Manufacturers of electric powertrains are concerned about super-fast charging of 20 minutes and less. Similarly, harsh discharges should be avoided as also this also adds to battery stress. Read more about <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries">Charging Lithium-ion</a>&nbsp;and <u><a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/ultra_fast_chargers">Ultra-fast Chargers</a>.</u></p>
<p>
	Commercial chargers do not allow changing the charge voltage limit. Adding this feature would have advantages, especially for laptops as a means to prolong battery life. When running on extended AC mode, the user could select the &ldquo;long life&rdquo; mode and the battery would charge to 4.00V/cell for a standby capacity of about 70 percent. Before traveling, the user would apply the &ldquo;full charge mode&rdquo; to bring the charge to 100%. Some laptop manufacturers may offer this feature but often only computer geeks discover them.</p>
<p>
	Another way to extend battery life is to remove the pack from the laptop when running off the power grid. The <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission</em>advises to do this out of concern for overheating and causing a fire. Removing the battery has the disadvantage of losing unsaved work if a power failure occurs. Heat buildup is also a concern when operating a laptop in bed or on a pillow, as this may restrict airflow. Placing a ruler or other object under the laptop will improve air circulation and keep the device cooler.</p>
<p>
	<strong>&ldquo;Should I disconnect my laptop from the power grid when not in use?&rdquo; </strong>many ask. Under normal circumstances this should not be necessary because once the lithium-ion battery is full the charger discontinues charge and only engages when the battery voltage drops. Most users do not remove the AC power and I like to believe that this practice is safe.</p>
<p>
	Everyone wants to keep the battery as long as possible, but a battery must often operate in environments that are not conducive to optimal service life. Furthermore, the life of a battery may be cut short by an unexpected failure, and in this respect the battery shares human volatility.</p>
<p>
	To get a better understanding of what causes irreversible capacity loss in Li-ion batteries, several research laboratories* are performing forensic tests. Scientists dissected failed batteries to find suspected problem areas on the electrodes. Examining an unrolled 1.5-meter-long strip (5 feet) of metal tape coated with oxide reveals that the finely structured nanomaterials have coarsened. Further studies revealed that the lithium ions responsible to shuttle electric charge between the electrodes had diminished on the cathode and had permanently settled on the anode. This results in the cathode having a lower lithium concentration than a new cell, a phenomenon that is irreversible. Knowing the reason for such capacity loss might enable battery manufacturers to prolong battery life in the future.</p>

To quote http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger: <br />
&#8220;Charge rate is often denoted as C or C-rate and signifies a charge or discharge rate equal to the capacity of a battery in one hour. For a 1.6Ah battery, C = 1.6A. A charge rate of C/2 = 0.8A would need two hours ...&nbsp; to fully charge the battery from an empty state, if supported by the battery. This also assumes that the battery is 100% efficient at absorbing the charge.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>You do not want to leave your battery in your laptop even if would remain at 40% because your laptop generates quite a bit of heat from use which is harmful to the batteries. The lithium batteries should be stored at 40% AND in a cool place.</p></div>

Normally, a quality charger will notice when the battery is full and cease attempts to overload it. But it&#8217;been proven that all chargers aren&#8217;t that smart, especially generic brand ones that may apply charging methods unsuitable for Li-Ion type. </p>

One comment - a couple of your graphs are the wrong way around - the convention is to have the independent variable on the x-axis. So, in the last graph, you should be reading off the number of cycles on the y-axis, against each charge/discharge rate on the x-axis. (The number of cycles is *dependent* on the charge/discharge rate).</p></div>

The voltage should be set to the voltage written on the battery and the max current should be set to 5% of total capacity. Obviously the polarity has to be connected correctly and the charging process should be left alone for awhile until the constant current disappears.

Capacity of battery remained constant for more than 2 years now, what might be due to such &#8216;soft charging&#8217;, but also due to quality of Sony batteries.<br />
Dell Studio XPS has excellent utility which simply turned charging off whenever user wishes.<br />

This article is not telling you to avoid putting your battery in an oven (or &#8220;owen&#8221; as you so aptly put), but to instead avoid using the laptop while on the power grid with the battery fully charged.</p>

<p>For all you derps out there (most of you, judging by your comments), this means that you should not keep the battery in the laptop while it is plugged in and you are using it. Laptops generate heat (hurr durr) and since the battery is in the laptop (again, hurr durr), it is exposed to the heat, AND is kept constantly at full charge while plugged in. So, no, genesis, one doesn&#8217;t require an oven to expose your battery to heat (derp). Laptop internals regularly get to 60-70 degrees Celsius, well above the stated ideal temperature for batteries.</p>

<p>And I CAN&#8217;T believe one of you actually stored a laptop battery for SIX MONTHS to GAIN battery life. What a tard. Never using a battery will zap the power quickly.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another thing. I left a laptop mostly plugged in for a year. It had VERY few discharges. Yet the battery lasted for only a 1/2 hour or so. So you tards be the judge as to whether or not keeping it plugged in with the battery installed leads to excess wear.</p>

<p>As for actually using the battery (when not plugged in), just use it. Avoid full discharges and don&#8217;t keep it in a hot area.</p>

<p>And for all you idiots wanting to magically make your depleted batteries work again: you are, as I mentioned, idiots. Everything has a lifespan. If you&#8217;ve had your battery for a while and used it often, then guess what? It&#8217;s old and used and you have to buy another one! YAY! HURR DURR!</p>

<p>And some derp mentioned people complaining about laptop performance: WTF are you talking about? Someone said that laptops function slower without the battery while on power, but that&#8217;s the only complaint I heard. You&#8217;re just a retard.</p>

<p>And someone here actually doesn&#8217;t grasp the concept of a discharge. Are you serious? Look up the word. Good Lord. Mega tards.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks everybody for decreasing my hope in humanity even more than previously. The internet does that quite often. Bye, retards.</p></div>

<p>I have been a geek and modelled this. If you take an average battery with a life of 600hrs in standby (the actual number dont matter here), then the total hours you get for the 100%DoD is actually more than the 10%DoD. Yes, you get more recharges, but less total hours of use. From the table in the article, the 50% DoD gives you the most number of hours out of the battery before it cannot get above 70%.</p>

<p>Its quality not quantity!</p>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>Table 2 states that for a full 100% discharge and full charge that the battery would last roughly 500 cycles, while one that has a 10% discharge and then charging back up to 100% would last roughly 4,700 cycles. I hope I understand that table correctly, if not please help me understand it better.</p>

<p>My question is that given that I would follow the 10% discharge cycle would that not cause the battery to &#8216;fail&#8217; sooner since discharging 10% and then charging to 100% 4,700 times would roughly equate to 470 100% discharges? I&#8217;m sure I may be misunderstanding something, but I don&#8217;t see how the numbers add up.</p></div>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>It is close, but it does depend what they mean by 10% DoD</p>

<p>If you look at the graph (figure 1), it shows that each time you charge, the &#8216;full&#8217; level on the battery is a bit less each time. The failure is when it can only get to 70%. So lets say you charge 2000 times, the batt may only charge to 80%, say. Then 10% DoD in this case will be (in your example) 10% of 80mAh. If they meant 10%DoD of the orginal batt capacity in each charge, then you are right but I doubt it. I say that because if that is what they meant, then they could not have done a 100% DoD case (how can you discharge 100mAh when the batt is only at 80mAh?)</p>

<p>So in your cals, where you have (100*0.10)*4,700  the 100 needs to be a decreasing value for each charge e.g. (100*0.1) + (99.9*0.1) + (99.5*0.1) or similar</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

I have seen proof time and time again that Li-Ion DOES benefit greatly from &#8220;conditioning&#8221; the battery by letting it discharge fully (until the device shuts itself down) and charging it 8-12 hours (repeat process) for the first 3-5 days.<br />
That could solve your problem, or you might just be getting old batteries.<br />
Next time you receive a new battery, try this method, I think you will be surprised.</p></div>

That could also be just down to the fact that this sort of cycling is used to calibrate the battery mater in some equipment - Apple Macs spring to mind here. So repeating this until your battery is in peak form (usually 3 or 4 cycles) will keep updating the calibration values and hence give you the most accurate reading. This in turn will give the longest time before the software of the device thinks the battery is nearly flat and shuts down to protect your information.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for the thread. It&#8217;s amazing the amount of FUD that there is out there, not helped by the fact that most manufacturers are particularly vague with regards to their battery care and handling instructions. They could all do with having an article similar to this, but specific to their particular battery, charger circuit and typical usage patterns, in their manual.</p></div>

I had a notebook computer charging module with an intermittent connection at the output, charging a minute or so, then disconnecting and allowing the computer to discharge a minute or so, then charging a little&#8230;&nbsp; In less than 1 day, the battery had no capacity - would not hold enough charge to hold up the computer for 10 seconds.&nbsp; The previous day it would power it for nearly 2 hours.&nbsp; The battery did not undergo any shock - the computer was sitting on a table.<br />
I&#8217;ve found the same for Ni-Cad (obviously) and also NiMH.<br />
My personal experience in using rechargeable batteries for the last 20 years consistently agrees with this rule.</p>

<p>That is, the 100% discharge got 10 times the power ouput as compared to the 10% depth. If assuming useful work was done in each depth, then in fact getting 500 cycles actually gets a bit more work than 4700 cycles of only 10% the depth.</p>

<p>This seems to me to say that the depth of discharge is much less important than you would initially think from just looking at the number of cycles alone, as the amount of output is actually slightly more under the deep cycle, but for practical purposes is close to equivalent.</p>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>Paul, I read the article and am saying that my 20+ years of experience with rechargeable batteries disagrees with one primary implication:&nbsp; The article implies that many partial cycles will allow the battery to keep full capacity longer.&nbsp; The &#8220;memory&#8221; effect that plagued NiCad chemistry and supposedly is not present in Li-Ion, is the effect that, if the battery is only partially discharged, then recharged, it will soon only have the capacity to which it is used, i.e., if you only discharge it 10% and then recharge it each time, after a number of cycles, the total mAH available will only be about 10% of its original capacity.&nbsp; My experience has found this true of NiCad, NiMH, and Li-Ion, although Li-Ion is the most forgiving.&nbsp; As I stated before, a faulty charger connection caused very small cycles on my last Li-Ion and it destroyed the capacity in days.&nbsp; I would certainly not recommend discharging any of these chemistries small amounts between recharges.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen this habit destroy capacity very prematurely numerous times.<br />
Most of today&#8217;s notebook computers have a hysteresis built into the charge cycle such that, if you fully charge it, no charging will occur until you have intentionally discharged it to some extent.&nbsp; This allows you to keep it plugged in for periods of time without excessive short charge cycles.&nbsp; Some also have the option to turn the charger off until it is really necessary at a low remaining charge.&nbsp; This is a clue that notebook computer manufacturers agree with me on this aspect.</p></div>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>Re. Charging / Discharging of Lithium Batteries - and useful life of the battery<br />
The Article and many of the Comments, as well as stressing prevention of overheating, (in a hot computer or a hot car) seem to indicate that length of battery life is a matter of how much you discharge the battery, and how often you charge it. So it can take 500 cycles of total discharge (100% discharged to 0%) or 4700 cycles of 10% discharge (100% charged dischragd to 90%). [see exchange between David &amp; Paul on April 07, 2011] They agree that the amount of work done by the Li-battery is pretty much the same whatever approach you take.</p>

<p>Many of the comments focus on avoiding overcharging - and some recommend keeping the Li-battery around 40% - 50%&nbsp; discharged, and topping it up frequently. Sounds like &#8220;ïf you don&#8217;t use it, you lose it&#8221;</p>

<p>So far so good. But I have a confusion which is (unless I overlooked something - want to avoid a &#8216;flame&#8217; from &#8216;derp&#8217;). I am concerned about undercharging a Li-Battery. This concern relates to a Lenovo Thinkpad system, but I imagine it could apply to many other Laptops.</p>

<p>I have a ThinkPad W520, and since the mains adapter is a brick 17cm x 8cm x 3.5cm weighing 750g (6.7"x 3.2&#8221; x  1.3&#8221; weighing 1.64 lbs) I figured from suggestions on thinkpads.com Support Community (http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?p=628326) that I can equally use a smaller mains Adapter also <br />
available from Lenovo. </p>

<p>The &#8220;Brick&#8221; has an output of 170W, 20V charging at 8.5A<br />
The smaller versions have an output 90W and charge at 4.5A <br />
so accordingly I bought a Lenovo 41R4494 Ultraslim Adapter which is 11.5 cm x 7cm x 1.7cm and weighs 377g (4.5&#8221; x 2.75&#8221;&nbsp; x 0.67&#8221; weighing under 12 ounces). I felt very pleased.</p>

<p>But now my ThinkPad is nagging me each time I switch on or close down:<br />
&#8220;Ïncorrect AC adapter is attached. <br />
This AC adapter may not provide enough power to your Thinkpad. Please reconnect the proper AC adapter.&#8221; <br />
i.e they mean I am ündercharging the battery, right?<br />
(That&#8217;s true, if I leave the UltraSlim attached while I work, the battery runs down. <br />
 Question: But is that bad? Maybe it runs down more slowly, than if the UktraSlim Adapter is *not* attached? Can it damage the control circuits in the battery or the mains adapter?</p>

<p>My compromise work routine uses the Li-battery for my working day, and I charge it overnight.<br />
1. I hibernate the computer - with remaining charge in the battery ca. 30% - leaving it plugged in to the UltraSlim charger overnight. <br />
2. In the morning I unplug the mains adapter, before waking up the computer (thereby avoiding the nag).<br />
&nbsp;  It&#8217;s back to 98% - 100% - showing 8 or 9 hours work available in the battery (the 9-cell)<br />
During the day, I use the computer on battery, in sporadic intervals of half to 1½ hours. Between each work interval I close the lid to hibernate. I rarely finish the day with less than 30% charge in the battery.</p>

<p>So now to my main questions:</p>

<p>A. is this routine harmful for the life of a Li-Battery?<br />
B. if not, why does Lenovo nag me for using the 4.5A mains adapter? <br />
&nbsp;  (it charges OK when I am not using the computer).<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Many thanks for any insight or  &#8216;light&#8217; the Team can shed on this subject.</p>

<p>Regards = John</p>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>I find this article very interesting. With the aim of trying to put it in practice by moving to a more sound &#8220;maintenance&#8221; of my Li-ion batteries, I was quickly listing them in my mind: I ve Li-Ion batteries on my notebooks (Asus and MacBook Air), my two photo-camera, my videocamera, my mobile phone.</p>

<p>So, two main insight I want to apply: 1) never leave a li-ion battery inactive for too long time (i.e. months), but keep electrons move from time to time; 2) store the battery at the best possible conditions, i.e.: low temperature, low humidity, about 40% of charge.</p>

<p>I should have no problems with mobile phones and notebooks, as I use them everyday so keeping them at about the charge level I want is something I can someway control (plug/unplug them appropriately). The only problem is the Mac which heats often and there&#8217;s no way to remove the battery if I want to give it some relief.</p>

<p>The real problems are with the photo/video camera: I don&#8217;t use them everyday, sometimes I don&#8217;t use them for a few months. How can I simultaneously apply both insights ?<br />
Suppose I charge them to some 40% (difficult to control, at least with the photo-cameras, while the Sony Videocam has a progress bar), and then I remove from the devices and leave them apart. I then go to re-charge them after 1 month (insight 1). How much charge can they loose in 1-month ? I imagine few enough so that to bring them back to 40% I should leave them plugged in 10 minutes ? </p>

<p>Is this something sound and workable ? </p>

<p>Because if not, then I should charge them more and then artificially use the devices intensely to make them discharge the battery again at about 40%. That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any universal charger/discharger that I can use to control how much charge/discharge I want to apply to a li-ion battery before I store them.</p>

<p>All this is so much easier with the Ni-MH Hybrid batteries (used in strobes for example) for which I&#8217;ve bought a Maha Powerex MH-C9400 charger/discharger and every few weeks I run a Refresh&Analyze; cycle specifically designed for optimal storage of the batteries (then, every few months I run another &#8220;stronger&#8221; program to fully re-generate them).</p>

<p>And what I would like to know is what is best (ex. during working hours, at my desk) ??&nbsp; :<br />
- let the laptop/phone plugged, so with battery near 100%, but almost not used (except for peak power use, such as in phones for some radio communications).<br />

As far as my logic goes then at least in 2011, it&#8217;s ok to keep your laptop plugged in with the battery attached, because<br />
1. if you charge to 100% and keep to AC on the charger is intelligent enough not to really start charging the battery again until it naturally drops to about 95%<br />
2. while on AC the laptop does not draw power from the battery (source Dell homepage)<br />
You have to keep in mind though to discharge it / charge it once in a while (from this page here it seems the best is to let it go to about 25%?).<br />
Only if your laptop gets very hot while using it on AC, is removing the battery a good idea as a hot laptop will also naturally heat up the battery (remove the battery and touch it, should give you an idea). This, as I understand, will make the battery loose it&#8217;s capacity more quickly.</p></div>

&#8220;Maybe I am the only one missing one aspect of the number of cycles verses depth of discharge: if you only get 500 cycles with 100% discharge, as compared to 4700 cycles with 10% discharge, those cycles are not equivalent.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is, the 100% discharge got 10 times the power ouput as compared to the 10% depth. If assuming useful work was done in each depth, then in fact getting 500 cycles actually gets a bit more work than 4700 cycles of only 10% the depth.&#8221;<br />
——————————————————————————————————————<br />
You are correct in your observation, but you should have taken it one step farther. Using the data of Table 2 which gives the number of cycles to 70% capacity as a function of depth of discharge, one can derive the relative amount of total energy extracted (a dimensionless quantity) from a Li-ion cell as a function of DoD:</p>

<p>100% DoD yields 500 units of energy from a Li-ion cell over its useful life;<br />
50% DoD provides 750 units;<br />
25% DoD provides 625 units; and<br />
10% DoD provides 470 units.</p>

<p>The data in Table 2 indicate that recharging when the capacity reaches 50% is optimal  over the other three options.</p>

If I fully use the battery until it&#8217;s empty (100% DoD) you have to compare that to 10 cycles discharging to 10% DoD, because that&#8217;s fulfilling the same usage; any other comparison is useless. So looking at these four values, the 25% DoD seems to be the best, but more values would be helpful.</p></div>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>I work research and development and have tested lithium-ion cells for years. Here are some points I have learned on lithium ion: </p>

<p>0. If a battery is in a device, the device always has some sort of battery management system. Full discharge (to 0 volts) should not be possible and does cause irreparable damage. &#8220;full discharge&#8221; to about 2.7V (0% state of charge) is normal.<br />
1. Storage will not rejuvenate or recover capacity. <br />
2. If you need to store long term, store it at  50% charge. This reduces self discharge and/or active material degradation.&nbsp;  <br />
3. Freezing can damage a cell by causing dendrites (crystalization) in the electrolyte components and piercing seperator or damaging material bonds.<br />
4. The lower the operating temperature - the slower the ion exchange.<br />
The higher the temperature - the higher the material degradation. Room temp is best.<br />
6. Once in a while, discharge the battery until the device cuts it off, fully charge it and leave it on the charger for a short time. This moves as many ions as possible from one electrode to the other keeping them free to move instead of &#8220;stubbornly stuck&#8221;.<br />
7. Remember different companies make different formulations of Lithium ion and Li-polymer that behave differently like High power, High capacity, long life ... there is always a trade off.</p></div>

<p>You want to run the laptop without the battery if you can. Don&#8217;t leave the battery in the laptop when you are connected on the 120 Vca. A poor battery charger will reduce your battery life with an bad charging method.</p>

<p>As it was said earlier, the optimal charge level is around 50% of the battery capacity. You don&#8217;t want to go crazy with your laptop&#8217;s charge level. I suggest you to use the laptop between 40-100% of your battery capacity and then recharge it.</p></div>

With that kind of use, I would recommend to recharge the battery the day before your coach / train journey. You may leave the battery at &#8220;whatever&#8221; remaining capacity for a few weeks if this capacity is over 25%. </p>

<p>If the remaining capacity is below 25%, recharge it until it reaches 40% and then store it until the next utilization.</p>

So No, you do not allow it to completely discharge. 10% discharges allow the battery to last for much longer, but are themselves too small to really be practical. If your laptop and charger have good control over the charging current, (a question this article does not even try to answer), then you should just leave it plugged as often as possible.</p></div>

What I said is that you &#8220;should leave the laptop plugged in with the battery as often as possible&#8221; IF the charging circuity is high enough quality. Unfortunately, neither this article nor the vendor specs tell us enough about the chargers: but overcharging is also bad for batteries, and poor chargers WILL overcharge the battery.</p>

<p>I am not sure which of my computers and chargers have high enough quality. I feel pretty confident of the Apple computers, less so of Radio Shack or Targus chargers bought for IBM compatibles.</p></div>

This will ensure that your battery is always in working condition Nothing to do when your battery is fully charged. Just remember never to store batteries at 100%, no matter what. Use your Laptop and bring it down to atleast 45% before storing. Remember your charger is only  working when  you are on plugged in mode.

Thanks for a great article!</p>

<p>But I wonder if the conclusion drawn on table 2 are absolutely accurate?</p>

<p>Here I have extended it with a third column, taking the deterioration into account.</p>

<p>&nbsp; DoD &nbsp; Cycles &nbsp;  Total Usabilty<br />
100%&nbsp;  &nbsp;   500 &nbsp;   435<br />
&nbsp; 50%&nbsp;  &nbsp; 1500 &nbsp;   638<br />
&nbsp; 25%&nbsp;  &nbsp; 2500 &nbsp;   531<br />
&nbsp; 10%&nbsp;  &nbsp; 4700 &nbsp;   400<br />
 <br />
The added last column says how many times of &#8220;full charge&#8221; you will get out of the battery in total during its life time with each approach.<br />
Assuming a linear deterioration of the battery from 100% to 70% of its original capacity (This assumption is backed by a graph in the article)<br />
So the integration is simple, and can be replaced by a mean factor of 85% [*] to the pure product.</p>

<p>This would yield that the optimal total capacity gained from the battery over its lifetime is a DOD of around 50%<br />
(Plotting the four points and combining with a smooth curve indicates that the maximum is around 60-50% DoD)</p>

<p>[*]<br />
More precisely<br />
 Sum&#123;n=0 to N-1 of DoD*(1-30%*n/N) &#125;<br />
=DoD*(N - 30%*Sum&#123;n=0 to N-1 of n/N&#125;)<br />
=DoD*(N - 30%(N-1)/2)<br />
=DoD*(N*85%-15%)<br />

Think logically for a moment: Companies have the legal obligation to deliver products who function within the expectations of their end users. If a product would actually be damaged extraordinarily (in this case a deep discharge would qualify for that) while its use is also within what could be expected from a normal user, then this might make the company vulnerable to law suits. Not just because they&#8217;d sell a falsely advertised product, but also because it would be dangerous.</p>

<p>A deep discharge should be avoided not just because it might ruin the battery, but also because such a battery might suddenly start to burn or even explode. Windows allows to go way below 11% (Xp 3%, Vista/7 5%), so as a result millions batteries would be damaged and a plethora might catch fire and burn&#8230;but that doesn&#8217;t happen&#8230;and for a reason:</p>

<p>A deep discharge per definition is when the cell voltage drops below a specified value. For 4.2V cell phone batteries this value is usually around 2.5V (60%). For notebook batteries that usually operate in the range of 10-12V I couldn&#8217;t find any values, but applying the same ratio as above, 60% would equal 6-7.2V.</p>

<p>To actually debunk your carelessly spit out claim I actually let my Notebook discharge the battery down to 30mW (0%) while I measured the battery voltage. The battery usually operated at 11.5V when the computer is connected with the charger. On battery the voltage is around 11V and goes down the more the battery is discharged. At 30mW charge the battery still had a cell voltage of 9.6V and thus was way above what would qualify for a deep discharge. </p>

<p>A deep discharge usually only occurs if a battery is used by devices that don&#8217;t turn off automatically on low charge and draw so little charge themselves that batteries can be discharged much longer and deeper than through normal devices. </p>

<p>Notebooks not just turn off automatically, they also need a pretty high charge level to even power up, so using up the battery entirely still leaves enough charge for the battery to not be damaged (anything else would be a pretty big oversight/design flaw, wouldn&#8217;t it). Li-ion batteries are equipped with small chipsets though that control the charging process and report stats back to the operating system. This also draws power, so discharging a battery down to 0% and storing it like that for weeks would eventually result in a deep discharge.</p>

<p>So, for all of those who are in doubt: try it out yourself if you are unsure. You can measure the battery voltage with hardware monitor.</p></div>

<p>&#8220;No, he should NOT wait until the battery is discharged to 11% That would be one of the deep discharges that shortens battery life.&#8221;</p>

<p>My reply was about explaining how 11% is NOT a deep discharge, because there is a clear definition of what a deep discharge is and which you apparently don&#8217;t know. I also never claimed that discharging the battery by 100% would not limit its recharge cycles. I didn&#8217;t even go near that.</p>

<p>You, Matt, need to learn to comprehend instead of just looking at a few isolated numbers in the desperate attempt to find proof for the twisted ideas you apparently try to convey.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re welcome to disprove what I actually said by using my own words, instead of just claiming that you got it right, while you clearly have no clue what you&#8217;re talking about&#8230;</p>

<p>Just to not just let your little statement die like it probably should, I&#8217;ll put table 2 into perspective. Something you should have done yourself instead of treating as the absolute truth. </p>

<p>First of all, table 2 is based on 4.2V cell phone batteries, while I was talking about notebook batteries. Both types are designed for totally different uses. While a cell phone battery is the sole source of energy for a cell phone&#8217;s life and is being recharged on a regular basis, a notebook battery is only there to deliver occasional power to a much greater extent. Charging also only takes place occasionally (granted the user/software/charging electronics) behave properly.</p>

<p>Secondly, the number of charges is determined by using an arbitrary value of battery life. The text even says so itself. Did you even read it or did you just look at the pretty graphs and numbers? The threshold value could be anything and the resulting measurements are of little use for other batteries. Proof lies in the numbers itself:</p>

<p>100% * 500 cycles = 50.000% total charge<br />
10% * 4700 cycles = 47.000% total charge</p>

<p>Discharging a battery by 100% nets more charge over the battery&#8217;s life than only using it up by 10%. So, even if the words you laid in my mouth were actually uttered by me, I&#8217;d still be right due to the fact that you didn&#8217;t analyze what you argued with. </p>

<p>Even better: The arbitrary threshold of 70% is unrealistic. Who gets rid of a battery just because the cell phone only offers 3 weeks of standby instead of 4? Who buys a horrendously expensive notebook battery just because the battery only delivers 5 hours of work time instead of 7? A threshold of 30% would be much more realistic and would probably show that the 100% discharge nets much more charge than the 10% one. The gap between 50% and 25% discharge would probably also get a lot smaller, or may be even vanish at all. I don&#8217;t know and you don&#8217;t either, but the  10% - 100% discrepancy shows that this table is of little worth for your argument. </p>

<p>Repeat the test with a wide array of current notebook batteries of different brands with at least 10 per brand to minimize statistical flukes and then you have some numbers to argue with. Right now you have squat, let alone logic or analytical skills.</p></div>

<p>Refering to Table 2<br />
Assuming a 10% DoD gives you 1 unit of use and you can recharge it 4700 times you&#8217;ve gotten 4700 units of use out of the battery.<br />
Now if you have a 25% DoD you get 2.5 units of use per recharge. You can recharge it 2500 times you&#8217;ve now gotten 6250 units of use from the battery.<br />
If you have a 50% DoD you now get 5 units of use per recharge. You can recharge it 1500 times you&#8217;ve now gotten 7500 units of use from the battery.<br />
If you have a 100% DoD you&#8217;ve now gotten 10 units of use per recharge. You can recharge it 500 times you&#8217;ve now gotten 5000 units of use from the battery.</p>

<p>In addition keeping the battery topped off is contradictory to the information contained in Table 3.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found I obtain the best life and length of use between charges by allowing the battery to dischage till the device tells me it needs to be recharged, and then recharging it at that time.</p></div>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>Looks like a few comments were deleted, including my reply to Matt and that without an explanation&#8230;nice.</p>

<p>Matt: Here&#8217;s the gist of my last reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were right about one thing: you should have “let my little statement die” instead of responding with your angry screed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yeah, try to sweep the fact under the rug that I cleared up your whole misconception about deep discharges and the erroneous &#8220;advice&#8221; you gave with it. That was also the sole purpose of my comment, so I guess I was right about two statements. Not a bad quota in a two statement post&#8230;</p>

<p><br />
&#8220;I never said anything about throwing a battery out after it is “deep discharged”. Nor if discharged to 11%.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never said you did.</p>

<p><br />
&#8220;Neither does the article. &#8220;</p>

<p>The article used 70% capacity as a threshold and called it &#8220;end of life&#8221;. I&#8217;d pretty much call a battery that has reached its end &#8220;dead&#8221;. What do you do with dead batteries? I throw them out&#8230;</p>

<p><br />
&#8220;Nor about throwing it out after three weeks of standby. That is your fantasy.&#8221;</p>

<p>No, that was an analogy to show you how useless numbers based on such high thresholds are. By definition of the article, you&#8217;d have to get rid of batteries at that point because they are considered dead. The conclusion you should reach, other than being sidetracked by your own poor way of arguing, is that a more realistic threshold might show that the charge that could be expected would be pretty much even for certain charge levels. May be the opposite would be the case, but no one knows that. That&#8217;s why you can&#8217;t use the numbers as a basis of your argument. Their nature just doesn&#8217;t allow any conclusions.</p>

<p><br />
&#8220;But the difference between 11% and 10% is obviously small.&#8221;</p>

<p>10% DISCHARGE of Table 2 != 11% CHARGE (=89% discharge). Yeah, the difference between 10 and 89% (or 90 and 11% if you want to look at the charge levels) is obviously small&#8230;</p>

<p><br />
&#8220;And how did you miss the title of the article? Despite your pretense, it is NOT specifically about 4.2V batteries, it is about Li-ion in general.&#8221;</p>

<p>And where does the article say that the protection circuit is the same for cell phone and notebook batteries? You imply they work exactly the same, even though that makes no sense at all since both battery types are designed for totally different usage scenarios.</p>

<p><br />
&#8220;Your angry screed, full of equivocation, shows only your own inability to understand either me or the article.&#8221;</p>

<p>Your obvious lack of understanding and your poor way of arguing make me rather smile than angry. How you get anger out of my reply is beyond me, but you&#8217;ve been misinterpreting the article and my replies so much that I&#8217;m not really surprised.</p>

<p>Btw, provide proof for your so called equivocations. My replies are right there. Use quotes for once in your life.</p>

<p><br />
&#8221; If anyone ever gets anything useful out of it—which is doubtful—it will be the article’s author realizing what he could have worded differently to better avoid confusion and needless arguments.&#8221;</p>

<p>The article is very clear in what it says. It just doesn&#8217;t take amateurs like you into account who can&#8217;t even distinguish percentages of charge and discharge levels&#8230;</p>

<p><br />
&#8220;But even if he had worded it perfectly, there is nothing he can do for anyone clueless enough to believe as you do, that “Companies have the legal obligation to deliver products who function within the expectations of their end users”. That was funny. &#8220;</p>

<p>Just because you found it funny doesn&#8217;t make it untrue. What I described is part of many case law and codified law based countries. You clearly are no lawyer and you also clearly lack proper common knowledge:</p>

<p>&#8220;If a defective product causes an accident that results in death, injury or property damage, the manufacturer, distributor, retailer and lessor of the product may be liable for the damages caused by the product. [...] The plaintiff must establish that a product has a defect that made it unreasonably dangerous at the time the product left the control of the defendant. [...] It may also be possible to show that the product was defective because it did not perform in keeping with the user&#8217;s reasonable expectations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Source: http://www.osbar.org/public/legalinfo/1047_DefectiveProducts.htm</p>

<p><br />
&#8220;Why did you THINK most software license agreements disavow any “fitness of purpose”?&#8221;</p>

<p>Software != Hardware. Software doesn&#8217;t explode or catch fire when being deep discharged. Also, show me such an agreement for any non-Software product. You won&#8217;t find any, but just in case you do, it would be in violation of basically any western law.</p></div>

I received two batteries with the phone but it is still a problem. I have let it get to 0 percent a couple of times and recharged it to 100 percent. This has not helped. I know not smart but it was a suggestion I read before I read the article. I have not had problems with previous phones when it comes to battery life. Am I doing something wrong?

<p>I&#8217;ve been monitoring my battery wear for a while now carefully with BatteryBar Pro v3.5.4 and my conclusion is that over-discharging and over-charging your battery is damaging and always results in wear.</p>

<p>So now I never allow the battery to trickle charge to 100% pulling out the plug before around 90% to 95% max. I then run  the battery until around 50% to 35% and then start charging it again. By doing this all the time, BatteryBar Pro registers the minimum amount of wear. In fact a slip from this regime always seems to result in a few percentage points of wear. I think I basically do manually what some systems can do automatically through a setting in the BIOS  (wish I knew about this feature before buying my laptop!).</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s my comment really. I really recommend BatterBar Pro so you can really keep an eye on what is going on. But remember the computer needs a restart for any wear level numbers to be updated.</p>

<p>Hope his helps! </p>

<p>I think the best thing to do is to charge to something like 97% to 98% and that will restrict the battery wear to the absolute minimum and won&#8217;t have to compromise too much batter capacity.</p>

<p>Having said that I think it is inevitable that you will need to fully discharge the battery from time to time when on the train for example but you just bear in mid that this will most likely damage you battery a bit unfortunately.</p>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>The battery university is a tremendous service.&nbsp; Thanks for keeping it updated.&nbsp; I agree with Herve&#8217;s typo corrections above.</p>

<p>I worked with batteries for many years, so I hope my words will take away some of the battery and charging anxiety that many have expressed in the comments.&nbsp;  Here are the key things to remember about Li Ion:<br />
1.&nbsp; Li Ion has a long shelf life, except if it is stored fully discharged.&nbsp; Hence, the common recommendation to store at about 40% state of charge or above.&nbsp; STORE BETWEEN 100% AND 40% STATE OF CHARGE..<br />
2.&nbsp; All name brand companies produce chargers that stop the LiIon charge at 100%.&nbsp; It is the best practice to allow the charger to complete the charge.&nbsp; Opportunistic charging (less than full charge) is ok and will not harm the battery.&nbsp; There are electronic control modules either in the battery pack or the charger that decide when the charge is complete.&nbsp; USE THE MANUFACTURER&#8217;S CHARGER AND ALLOW THE CHARGE TO COMPLETE MOST OF THE TIME.<br />
3.&nbsp; You do not need to store the battery in the refrigerator and it may be harmful to store the battery in the freezer.&nbsp; Your battery is happy at the same temperature you are comfortable.&nbsp; The most important thing you can do for the battery is do not leave it in the car on a hot day.&nbsp; Same goes for your dog or your kids.&nbsp;  STORE THE BATTERY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.<br />
4.&nbsp; If you are usually plugged in when you work, the battery does not even need to be in your laptop. (Check your instruction book or if you have children, use good judgment.)<br />
 Just make sure the battery terminals are taped so you do not inadvertently short it.&nbsp; OR Try not plugging in the laptop some work sessions. Most will tell you when the battery is getting low and you have plenty of time to plug it in (but this is using up your battery life).&nbsp;   Either way avoids keeping the battery at full state of charge all the time and repetitive charging (starting charge on a fully chargd battery) which is detrimental to battery life.&nbsp; There is a variety of charger quality on the market.&nbsp; Some battery/charger combinations will detect this situation sooner than others.&nbsp;  TRY NOT TO KEEP YOUR BATTERY ON CHARGE OR FULLY CHARGED ALL THE TIME.</p>

<p> I understand the batteries are expensive and you want the most life out of them.&nbsp; To get the most life from the battery really is as simple as the 4 BEST PRACTICES listed above.&nbsp; Your life is too short to be babysitting your batteries trying to decide the depth of discharge for today and/or running to the fridge for a battery.&nbsp; Enjoy.</p>

I have really enjoyed reading the articles and the comments/speculations.&nbsp; I have a few of my own, and I would love to hear back from all (almost) of you. First, from reading the comments and seeing that there is not 100% agreement on the &#8220;do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts&#8221;, it would seem to me there is a missing factor, which I would respectfully suggest is manufacturing quality of the battery.&nbsp; From my own experience, I have had some devices which were abused, yet maintained good runtime capacities for long lifespans, as well as others that were &#8220;babied&#8221; and died ridiculously premature and expensive deaths. In the case of laptop packs and other multiple cell assemblies like those used with cordless tools, my forensic investigations reveal individual cells which have failed either by shorting or some form of diminished capacity which renders the entire pack useless.</p>

<p>My question today concerns the use of different charging connections and their effect on rates/quality of charge;&nbsp; as was mentioned by some, the charging circuitry is contained within the device (cell phone).&nbsp; As such, how is it that I get a faster charge from, say, the one that plugs into the cigarette lighter as compared to the one that is usb powered?&nbsp; Obviously the voltage sources are different, but does that mean the phone is so &#8220;smart&#8221; it is deciding for me whether I want a quick charge or a very slow one? Shouldn&#8217;t the phone look at the incoming source and automatically regulate it down to the appropriate rate? All of the automotive and 120v receptacle charges I have charge at a rate that is much faster than usb.&nbsp; Is then the usb the preferred way?<br />

I will get my 2 cents worth in and then hopefully some others will have something to add.&nbsp; From what you are describing, which includes both short run times and long charge times, I would have to conclude that your battery packs are reaching the end of their useful lives.&nbsp; The condition you describe sounds to me like the internal resistance of the batteries is rising.&nbsp; If you ascribe to the philosophies of B.U., then you understand that it is not possible to rejuvenate the lithium cells, and could also be dangerous to try. Unfortunately, the lesson you have learned is one I think most of us are perpetually repeating, and I am struggling to understand completely what the process is that destroys most of these cells.&nbsp; I have had very very few of these lithium cells which lived up to their stated life expectancies.&nbsp; My own experience would suggest 3 main factors: #1: Quality / proper use of charger circuit.&nbsp; #2.: Quality of actual Lithium cells.&nbsp; #3: Usage patterns and environmental (heat) considerations.&nbsp; The comments listed above from Janet are along the same lines as what I believe; In effect, we are inadvertently &#8220;killing&#8221; a lot of these by putting them/ leaving them on chargers that are not well engineered.</p></div>

I know I&#8217;ve only recharged it (maybe) 70 times.&nbsp; Well short of the 200+ re-charge cycles.<br />
But the camera / battery never get cold or hot.&nbsp; As soon as the charge is complete, I put the battery back in the camera.&nbsp; At the rate I use the battery, will it last another 7 years?&nbsp; Or is there a finite time it will last?<br />
I have a digital volt meter.&nbsp; Is there a simple measurement I could make - that would give me an indication how much life there is in the battery pack?<br />
FYI: Immediately after charging the battery measured 8.31v<br />
One hour later is was 8.29v<br />
Eight hours later it was still 8.29v</p>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>Pier, the Battery Discharger you link to is mostly for testing batteries not for recommended maintenance or improving the battery. </p>

<p>The benefits of discharging a battery depends on the battery type (chemistry). For lead-acid battery, deep discharge is BAD for the battery and will shorten its lifetime. For nickel-cadmium some people recommend occasional full-discharge and the re-charge, citing the &#8220;memory effect&#8221; of nickel-cadmium chemistry - I think your question may be about nickel-cadmium. Other people claim the &#8220;memory effect&#8221; is a myth. You will find good information on this battery-university site, it is a very good source of info on batteries of all kinds.</p>

<p>Lithium-ion, like lead-acid, does not benefit from deep discharge - you will get longer life from lithium-ion chemistry by only discharging to 25-30% and re-charging to 80-90% - storing it at full charge (100%) for a long time is also not good - which is the topic of this forum, actually. There are some good articles and graphs here that explain it.&nbsp; - DL</p></div>

I believe you introduced LiFePO4 into the discussion. There is obviously a difference between a battery that powers a handheld drill, small enough to have a steel spike driven through it with impunity, and a very large battery, powerful enough to start one of the largest turbofan jet engines currently in use. </p>

<p>I have discharged my battery below 5% about 10 times in the first 3 weeks and let it run to 0% twice. I have now taken steps to charge the battery at about 30%. However, the battery monitor pro app currently estimates it&#8217;s capacity as 2143mah so doesn&#8217;t seem to have affected it.</p>

<p>The spare battery (official GS3 accessories pack) has only lost 4% power after 1.5 months of storage time starting on 100%.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;d like more information about is table 3 because I dislike what is being said there and the numbers look suspicious relative to the words. Surely the battery does not lose 20% of its maximum capacity permanently after 3 months if it is sitting at 100% and 25 degrees? I mean if the spare GS3 battery only lost 4% temporarily (ie. can be recovered via charging), surely it has not lost 15% permanently in just 1.5 months.</p>

<p>If this statement was true then spare batteries can only ever have 40% of the original maximum capacity if stored at 100% for a year.</p></div>

<p>&#8220;Here we report a memory effect in LiFePO4—one of the materials used for the positive electrode in Li-ion batteries—that appears already after only one cycle of partial charge and discharge&#8221;</p>

My own opinion is that whoever sold you these is blowing smoke to stall you and prevent you from asking for a refund. I have heard mixed opinions both here and other places about the validity of exercising a lithium battery, but the technique suggested to you sounds more like a NiCad strategy to me.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t find the link right now, but there is a guy who has a pretty good blog dedicated to reviewing the various replacement batteries out there.&nbsp; Maybe you can do a search and locate it.&nbsp; He has found that many, many of them are lying about the actual capacity of the cells.

I think this is the site:&nbsp; http://www.batteryreview.info/&nbsp;  I purchased 2 of the Gorilla Gadgets high capacity for the Galaxy S3. I hated running from charger to charger. Now I have one in the phone, which averages about 3 days with my usage, and I carry the other charged one and simply change out. I don&#8217;t ever use the charger that connects to the phone-just a cube-style charger that plugs in to the wall; leave it overnight, and then take it with me.&nbsp; I have concluded that the whole idea of obtaining maximum life and output is not as relevant as reliability and consistency- realistically nobody keeps devices that long any more. I probably throw away devices that have better batteries in them than what I was getting brand new 10 years ago.</p>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>From a pure engineering perspective, your point is taken.&nbsp; However, many of the people here are seeking practical ways to extend the life of their batteries.&nbsp; The extreme example is if you never discharge the battery, it should last forever.&nbsp; Not only is this untrue, it also completely defeats the purpose of having a portable device in the first place. I believe the misunderstanding may lie in the definition of a cycle; even the author points out that there is disagreement among experts.&nbsp; How many of us have had the experience of “taking care of “ a battery by keeping it constantly charged only to discover the capacity of the battery has diminished rapidly anyway? I think there are other factors that may override the basics of DOD and total number of cycles.&nbsp; In one of these articles the author points out that the worst thing you can do to your battery is to use it while you are charging, yet that is what most of us are constantly doing with a cell phone; It gets low on charge, and you still need to use it, so you plug it in and continue your conversation. The author suggests that this induces many tiny cycles of charge/discharge, in turn creating lots of heat, which might account for the shortened battery life over time.</p></div>

<p>But what&#8217;s worse, running your laptop of the power grid (thus having a fully charged bettery) or stop charing when it&#8217;s at 80%, drain it to 30-40% and charge again? </p>

<p>I&#8217;m asking because in when you run it of the grid, the battery becomes warm whilst being full. When not running of the power grid, you&#8217;re causing another cycle, and it only has a limited amount of cycles. What&#8217;s the &#8216;least&#8217; bad for my battery?</p></div>

<p>It really is a shame that no notebook manufacturer has a 50% charge option. It would still be good enough to use as a ups in case of a power outage, but the battery could last for 5 years or even more.

This was when I used my laptop somewhat sparingly and did this on purpose to find out the maximum battery backup.</p>

<p>My settings -</p>

<p>1. Display is always 0, the lowest brightness possible. The background is full black, screensaver is full black, browser background is full black. In general in every software if it is possible to have total pitch black background I go for it. Actually it looks very sleek and you may not recognize it is the same as your usual softwares. I do it primarily yo save my eyes [oh yes, i love my eyes more that the environment] but it also prolongs battery life.</p>

<p>2. when running on battery, my processor is underclocked to 60%. </p>

<p>3. my laptop is set to switch the display off after 1 minute. the laptop itself never sleeps or hibernates. i dont like to wait for my machine to switch on if i resume my work. the HDD is put to sleep after 20 minutes of inactivity.</p>

<p>4. my laptop is NEVER switched off. this one is about 6 months old and I have switched it off for more than an hour only 3-4 times. Moreover it is permanently connected to the AC power. so far my laptop has run on battery (for more than a couple of hours) only twice in the last six months.</p>

<p>the result is that my battery is almost as good as new. any battery shows strength decay only after about 100 discharge cycles. mine has been to only (maximum) five discharge cycles and I intend to keep it that way. no wonder I get such a long backup.</p></div>

<p>1. I keep battery between 40 and 70 percent charge all the time. My reasoning is that I want to keep the voltage per cell low by not charging it too high, and I want to make the depth of discharge as low as possible since i will be using it at home and will always have a charger available.</p>

<p>2. Keep battery between 20 and 50 percent. - same logic, but I think keeping the voltage even lower by not charging my laptop above 50 percent will also help improve battery life.</p>

<p>While I know next to nothing compared to a lot here I just had to jump in wth my thoughts.<br />
When you consider the cost versus the lifetime of these packs they are not that expensive, baby them and get say 12 months against using them without worrying about longevity, but not abusing them, and getting 9 months, say you pay $60 for the battery, thats $5 a month babying against $6.66 a month without worrying, is all the fuss worth $1.66 a month ?</p>

<p>I use 16650 3000mah batteries in high powered modded led flashlights, they are always fully charged when not in use, often have 3A or 4A load on them, never taken below 2.8 v although sometimes taken to 3v, the lights get hot, the battery compartment sometimes getting to 50c or so, is this abuse, you bet, will it shorten there lifespan, yes, but I am prepared to put up with it to follow this hobby, what I am getting at is sometimes you just have to do what you have to do, and if that means discharging the batteries until you laptop tells you they are flat, then just accept you have shortened the life of the battery a tiny little bit and move on.</p>

<p>I am in no way putting down anyone here, treat them nice and they last longer, of special interest to myself was not leaving a laptop pack out of the laptop for more than about a month, my wife has two packs and she just leaves one pack out fully charged until she needs it, not now she won&#8217;t <img src="http://batteryuniversity.com/images/smileys/smile.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="smile" style="border:0;" /></p>

<p>when i turn it on and use the laptop, the battery charges to: 60% available (plugged in, not charging)</p>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>I have a smartphone with li-ion battery. It&#8217;s Sony Xperia SP and it has built-in battery. First it was great but then because of that useless battery doctor task killing app, one night I left my mobile with 22% charge left and tomorrow when I woke up, it was 0%.<br />
Since then I feel like my mobile battery is not good. My habit is to charge mobile when it is below 15% and I never plug it out until its 100%. Last night at 4am I left it on stand by with 72% and today in the morning it was below 58%. There was only one message and the notification light was turned off in the settings.<br />
What should I do?</p></div>
