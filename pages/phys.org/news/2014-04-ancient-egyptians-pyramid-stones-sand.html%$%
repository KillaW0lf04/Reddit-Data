					Physicists from the FOM Foundation and the University of Amsterdam have discovered that the ancient Egyptians used a clever trick to make it easier to transport heavy pyramid stones by sledge. The Egyptians moistened the sand over which the sledge moved. By using the right quantity of water they could halve the number of workers needed. The researchers published this discovery online on 29 April 2014 in <i>Physical Review Letters</i>.

				    <p>For the construction of the pyramids, the ancient Egyptians had to transport heavy blocks of stone and large statues across the desert. The Egyptians therefore placed the heavy objects on a sledge that workers pulled over the sand. Research from the University of Amsterdam has now revealed that the Egyptians probably made the desert sand in front of the sledge wet. Experiments have demonstrated that the correct amount of dampness in the sand halves the pulling force required.</p>
<p><b>Firm sand</b></p>
<p>The physicists placed a laboratory version of the Egyptian sledge in a tray of sand. They determined both the required pulling force and the stiffness of the sand as a function of the quantity of water in the sand. To determine the stiffness they used a rheometer, which shows how much force is needed to deform a certain volume of sand.</p>
<p>Experiments revealed that the required pulling force decreased proportional to the stiffness of the sand. Capillary bridges arise when water is added to the sand. These are small water droplets that bind the <a href="http://phys.org/tags/sand+grains/" rel="tag" class="textTag">sand grains</a> together. In the presence of the correct quantity of water, wet desert sand is about twice as stiff as <a href="http://phys.org/tags/dry+sand/" rel="tag" class="textTag">dry sand</a>. A sledge glides far more easily over firm desert sand simply because the sand does not pile up in front of the sledge as it does in the case of dry sand. </p>	  <!--begin:image-block-->

<p>The Egyptians were probably aware of this handy trick. A wall painting in the tomb of Djehutihotep clearly shows a person standing on the front of the pulled sledge and pouring <a href="http://phys.org/tags/water/" rel="tag" class="textTag">water</a> over the sand just in front of it.</p>
<p>Besides revealing something about the ancient Egyptians, the results are also interesting for modern-day applications. We still do not fully understand the behaviour of granular material like <a href="http://phys.org/tags/sand/" rel="tag" class="textTag">sand</a>. Granular materials are, however, very common. Other examples are asphalt, concrete and coal. The research results could therefore be useful for examining how to optimise the transport and processing of granular material, which at present accounts for about ten percent of the worldwide energy consumption. </p>
<p>The research was supervised by FOM group leader professor Daniel Bonn and is part of the FOM programme 'Fundamental aspects of friction'.<br /></p>

The formation of capillary water bridges increases the shear modulus of the sand, which facilitates the sliding. Too much water, on the other hand, makes the capillary bridges coalesce, resulting in a decrease of the modulus; in this case, we observe that the friction coefficient increases again."<br/>No rest! <br/>Time to go to the beach and play in the sand.

			<div id="cm_748486">Think of this hypothesis when studying these events: <br/>In the late Pleistocene the Moon was in a low and unstable orbit due to Pangaea's weight all on one side of Earth, causing imbalance. The Moon then came in for a landing, impacting the Mediterranean, scraping and burning material pushing into a pile known as the Appalachia mountain range, exhuming massive amounts of limestone to form the Ozarks, Rock of Gibraltar, Betic Cordilleras, the many structures throughout southwest U.S., Ecuador, Chile and Peru and covering the Yucatan Peninsula, the pyramids and temples in melt rock.<br/>This lunar impact event not only caused mass extinction, it slowed the outer plates and mantle in relation to the faster moving inner core, causing an increase in electromagnetism, gravity and the length of Earth's day [by approx. 34 min.]<br/>Many if not most of the monolithic structures were built during the Pleistocene, when there was considerably less gravity.Thisisthereason!<br/><a href="http://able2know.org/topic/224693-1" title="http://able2know.org/topic/224693-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://able2know....224693-1</a></div>

It doesn't really make any sense, but go ahead and just discount the question with, well people were just trying to survive and expand.  Yea, that makes sense.  The population over the last 12K years has increased exponentially, but previous to that we just couldn't figure out how to have babies and survive.</div>

Lots of people don't want to change unless they have to.<br/><br/>Hunting and gathering in bands of ~30 was actually wildly successful for a long time. But they couldn't build a community larger than ~30 with that way of living. Basic h&amp;g didn't support more than ~30 people on I forget how many sq miles. When they had surplus people, those people had to move away and start their own band on a new territory.<br/><br/>One version of what happened next has the previous ice age kill off many from those bands of ~30 and the survivors eventually moving ~South. Larger communities seemed to have just sort of happened around then, as people figured out some tricks to make it work. Hunting megafauna (mammoths etc) with drives and falls, or hunting small game with beaters. Specialization.</div>

The Breasted translation was only of the text immediately behind the scene of the workmen pulling the statue.  My Egyptian is really rusty (haven't really used it in years) so I would make no claims about certainty as to the contents of the translation and what it doesn't say.  The original is now badly damaged and even Breasted didn't complete the translation of text.  The color of the paint in what is left of the original suggests pouring of water. In Egyptian artwork, pouring of libations for dedications of statues is displayed differently.  The water would be shown being poured over the head and onto the ground for such a libation ritual. Not the case here.</div>

The color of the liquid being poured suggests water or something water-based.  Three indicates plurality in Egyptian, and three in inscriptions can indicate any number more than two in Egyptian texts.  Multiple groups of two and three also are used to indicate a very great task using numerous people.  What is depicted taking place here is the work of moving the statue, not the dedication and libation ceremonies that took place after the statue is placed.  The pouring is simultaneous with pulling.  The guy on the knees provides a beat.  Unfortunately, the man pouring the water isn't named in what is left of the inscription.</div>

They used large sledges much like those in the image.<br/><br/>It also is a substantial improvement on the way they did things a few hundred years before.

He compares the chronology of the Old Testament and its factual content with ancient Egyptian records to show that the major characters of the Hebrew scriptures--including Solomon, David, Moses, and Joshua--are based on Egyptian historical figures. He further suggests that not only were these personalities and the stories associated with them cultivated on the banks of the Nile, but the major tenets of Christian belief--the One God, the Trinity, the hierarchy of heaven, life after death, and the virgin birth--are all Egyptian in origin. He likewise provides a convincing argument that Jesus himself came out of Egypt."<br/><br/>Amen (hotep.)</div>

			<div id="cm_750703">Are we sure that the substance poured is water - or just water? For example olive oil would have reduced friction even more, lasted much longer on the sand and required less volumes than water - important where multiple objects (blocks perhaps) are moved on the same track of sand. Even a clay/water slurry would have been better than just water alone. Remembering that the Egyptians were also experts in making bricks - they would necessarily understand the slipperiness and reduced coefficients of friction typical of wet clay slurry. Personally I'm guessing water only is not probable because it would only reduce friction 1. in a specific ratio of water to sand that had to be maintained in balance over long distances 2. the state of lubrication only exists for a short period until the ratio of sand to water is changed by seepage into the surrounding and dryer sand and or evaporation, and 3. the immense volumes of water involved for moving objects any significant distance. </div>

In that case, you not only see the liquid poured directly onto the feet of the statue, but the inscription text itself actually states that offerings of water and milk are being poured.

There was a reason why the person pouring the water before the sledge often actually was the leader of the workmen.  The person doing it had to know what one was doing.  Too much water or too little and sand wells up in front of the sledge.  They also used Nile silt in constructing roads on which they dragged heavy objects.<br/><br/>The ancient Egyptians used natron, lime and water to make a form of caustic soda.</div>

The Mayans did not build pyramids within caves or temples beneath water. The many cities were not just buried by the inhabitants and left.Look up present 'CLAPTRAP' theories,<br/>The Moon is the only object with enough mass, weight, volume, density and in close enough orbit to break apart a supercontinent and still be able to achieve stable orbit leaving a more balalnced planet. <br/><br/>You see- it is a weight and balance issue and has happened many times, AND, when the ice melts and the equator has accumulated too much weight, this will, once again occur.

			<div id="cm_772585">Absolute BS, Kalopin.  The Mariana Trench is a subduction zone, caused by the Pacific plate undergoing subduction below the Philippine plate.  In fact, this has been measured.  Want to see a real set of divergent plates? Look no further than the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, particularly evidenced by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  There is zero evidence of this kind of divergence in the Mariana Trench.  It has been and is being studied.<br/><br/>Once again, a glancing impact large enough to gouge out the Mediterranean would have pulled on the Arabian plate and pulled it westward.  This would have caused the Indian plate to change direction and would have resulted in there being no Himalayas as we know them today.  In addition, it would have pushed the Eurasian plate into the N. American plate.<br/><br/>And, the moon would have been nothing more than a ring of dust orbiting the earth had it ever come that close.  The pyramids built during the Pleistocene? They have been dated and don't date to that period.</div>

You need to take some serious geology and other science courses, and learn about the Roche limit.  You are going to have to figure out how the moon would have survived something like that and how humans survived 500-plus mph winds while leaving behind zero evidence of being sandblasted to death.<br/><br/>You are going to have to explain how it is that pyramids were built during the Pleistocene when they are datable to known persons in Egypt from within historical times.  Your hypothesis is invalidated from start to finish.  Trouble is, your understanding of the science is so limited that you have no idea that such is the case.<br/><br/>Claptrap.  Nothing more.</div>

			<div id="cm_772741">Skepticus Rex,<br/><br/>     There is so much more! You really need to read the information on every thread, as it still needs to be consolidated. The scraping and scarring across the sea floor is still easily viewable, proving this had to occur recently.<br/><br/>     The Arabian plate was attached to west Africa, along with the other continents that broke away at impact. This force is what started the plates drifting. The Arabian plate could not have accomplished this action by any other means. So, how could this impact have changed this if it was the cause?<br/><br/>     The 'Roche limit' is misunderstood as well. If an object has enough mass, it has a limti too and will produce electromagnetic repulsion, actually slowing the impact even more...<br/><br/>     It is you who needs to give better study, as you are unable to give ANY mechanism for ANY of the forementioned anomolies and events! I run into so many, just like you, with the blinders put on by years of "phaulty fysics" and distorted history lessons.PLEASE!</div>

			<div id="cm_773296">BS, Kalopin. If a comet ever hit North America there would be no North America.  Unbelievable.  You cited as evidence a page that weakens your hypothesis of a meteorite shower causing the Carolina Bays.  I quote:<br/><blockquote> Meteoritic impact is no longer widely regarded as a plausible hypothesis. No meteoritic fragments have been found that are genetically related to the Carolina Bays. No known meteorite falls elsewhere in the world have resulted in approximately half a million depressions over a wide area. Studies of magnetic anomalies associated with individual bays are not conclusive (MacCarthy, 1936; Prouty, 1952). Shatter cones and high pressure changes in quartz grains associated with known impact craters are absent. The heavy mineralogy of sediments within one bay did not differ from sediments beyond the bay rim (Preston and Brown, 1964). The selective confinement of Carolina Bays to one physiographic province has also been cited as evidence against any extraterrestrial hypothesis. </blockquote></div>

			<div id="cm_773428">Skepticus Rex,<br/><br/>     The 1811 event was from a comet's tail, many small fragments of mainly ice and sand, little iron. Cometary impacts are not iron asteroid impacts and impact science is badly flawed. The lack of spherules and any magnetic anomolies has little to nothing to do with a cometary serial impact. Many of the meteors exploded when contacting the troposphere. <br/>     The Carolina bays formed from a serial impact of meteors made from ice and sand, impacting on frozen ground in one of the coldest winters on  record- instant steamy lakes...<br/><br/>     A comet did impact the Hudson bay in approx. 8500 b.c., emptying out lake Agassiz, pushing Greenland to the northeast and ending thhe Clovis culture. Beside the fact that it is so round and can easily make out the shatter effect, the magnetic anomaly is a 'smoking gun' as the cometary nucleus must still be attached [welded and magnetically] to the Mantle...<br/><br/>     and a meteor impacted north Mississippi on December 16, 1811...pleasestudy;]</div>

			<div id="cm_773665">The closest approach of a comet in historical times was Halley's Comet.  The comet of 1811 was never that close.  Impact science is flawed??? Apparently you really were unaware of the observations of the impacts of fragments of Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter.  The destructive force caused by those pieces of "ice and sand" was extensive.  This was physically observed!<br/><br/>The results of the observation were then transposed onto earth.  Had just one of those fragments hit earth all complex life on this planet would have been exterminated.<br/><br/>Carolina Bays were not formed by meteoric impacts.  Zero evidence of this has been found and they do not all line up in the same directions in spite of the optical illusion that they do.<br/><br/>Lake Agassiz??? 8500 BCE??? Give me a break.  Try earlier than 10,000 BCE.  There was no cometary impact in Hudson Bay or we would not be discussing this now. See above as to why.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~spencer/impactearth.gif" title="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~spencer/impactearth.gif" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.boulde...arth.gif</a><br/><br/>Just 1 impact radius of 1 fragment!</div>

			<div id="cm_773710">As to the meteorite impact in Mississippi in 1811, once again, no lighted were seen to come down from the sky.  All lights seen came up from the ground.  This is consistent with the kinds of electrical discharges that occur during and just before large seismic disturbances.<br/><br/>One major problem (of many) with your hypothesis is that what is now Connecticut was once a tropical island.  Several parts of the East coast of what is now the US actually came from elsewhere, drifted northward and slammed into the East Coast.<br/><br/>Limestone is sedimentary stone.  Plate tectonics caused the former seabed to thrust upward above sea level.  Mount Everest was once undersea, too.  Almost the entire Yucatan is limestone, no "impact ejecta blanket" required.<br/><br/>The Gulf of Mexico began forming during the Jurassic Era, with completion after the Cretaceous as the Caribbean plate pushed through toward the east.  That plate is moving the wrong direction if caused by a supposed moon impact northward. Claptrap all!</div>

			<div id="cm_773722">By the way, Kalopin, there is zero evidence for a Hudson Bay impactor, and plenty of people have been looking for the geological evidence of an impactor because of the shape of the "rim" that exists there.  So far as I am aware, none has yet been found.  It is less likely that any will be found, anyway, since its distinctive shape is the result of seismic activity and tectonic activity and movements.  Even though that entire region is rising year by year, as the glaciation that caused its deformation and depression no longer is present, the Hudson Bay is going to get a whole lot bigger over the next 160,000,000 years or so at the current rates of movement.<br/><br/>As I have suggested several times, take Geology courses and make thorough effort to understand the subject matter.</div>

Sorry but stating what I see is the truth of the situation.  Your hypothesis is not proven.

Zero evidence of any of it has been found.<br/><br/>Your model contradicts the actual directions that tectonic plates are moving, and movements can be observed using GIS and other technologies.  In addition, you have zero plausible explanation of how the moon could survive a close brush with the earth, how the Alps could form and yet not have a set of like on the African Continent, but the standard model actually explains the whole as it exists today.<br/><br/>Your own sources cited say the lights originated from the ground.  And what struck Jupiter was a mere set of fragments of the comet.  Nearly all you post is claptrap.</div>

The pyramids of Egypt mostly can be and have been dated.  They do not date to the Pleistocene.  Period.  The names of the individuals for whom the pyramids were constructed are known historical personalities and they can be dated.  The Maya actually put dates on their temples and monuments, so we also know when many of them were built.  None date to the Pleistocene.  Like many aspects of your hypothesis, this one falls flat in the face of the evidence.  That's all the claptrap I have time for at the moment....  Maybe more later.</div>

The term "meteoric flash," while typically referring to meteorites that explode in the air and never reach the ground, but which light up the sky, it also has been known to be used to describe lightning that lights up the sky.<br/><br/>In either case, whether the atypical meaning or the typical meaning, both terms mean no meteorite strikes the ground.  Thus, there is no cause for the 1811/1812 New Madrid earthquakes to be attributed to comet strikes or to meteorite strikes.<br/><br/>One of Kalopin's sources describes a meteoric flash, thus no meteorite nor cometary crash.<br/><br/>Yet another portion of Kalopin's hypothesis bites the dust.</div>

The moon still exists as a moon so we know that an impact did not happen in the Pleistocene.  Several close approaches like those you postulate would have reduced the moon to a ring of dust circling around the Earth.  Period.  Gravitational forces would have ripped the moon to shreds regardless of its composition, and mankind would have ceased to exist.<br/><br/>The cliffs themselves were split by a large lake during the last ice age.  Erosion left it in the condition it now exists.  Erosion continues to remove large chunks of the cliffs from time to time, between a couple inches of shedding every year on both sides of the Channel.</div>

Even Herodotus talks about the body being moved and hidden on another location to prevent further desecration.<br/><br/>The reason for such an effort would be understood by you if you had even an inkling of genuine Egyptian beliefs and mythology.  There is no Dendera lightbulb.  That is a misinterpretation of what it represented.  It is highly stylized artwork and nothing more.<br/><br/>Uranium ores have been mined for thousands of years.  They were used for pigmentation in pottery glazes.  They still are today in many places.<br/><br/>And, on and on it goes.  The only person in denial in this discussion is you.

The Great Pyramid has no external markings because the outer limestone casing on the pyramids was stolen and used in construction in later years.  Many of the pyramidia also have been stolen over the years.  These also contained inscriptions and were placed at the tops of the various pyramids.  But, now most of them are gone.  Only a very few remain.<br/><br/>You were aware that there are ways to date inscriptions besides paleography and reading the inscriptions themselves, right? How do you think forgeries often are exposed?<br/><br/>The Egyptians did not have flying machines.  That is another misinterpretation of the artwork in inscriptions.  You're probably one of those cranks who thinks that Akhenaton was part alien, aren't you?<br/><br/>The moon produces tidal forces as a result of its orbit.  Wegener was wrong about these tidal forces causing continental drift.  We know the mechanism now.  It's not the moon.</div>

You  have zero evidence of a meteoric impact causing the 1811/1812 earthquakes and aftershocks.  Your own source shows that no meteorite hit the ground because the usual meaning of a meteoric flash is a meteor exploding in air before it has any chance of hitting ground.  If it hits there is no meteoric flash.<br/><br/>The marks spoken of in the pyramid in your cited article were from the construction, not added later.  No human entered where they were found.

I have looked at photos of these writings and definitely the name of Khufu appears on some of the stones, as are dated inscriptions with names of workers.  Some of these are in places where no man could go or fit now (between stones!) so they had to have been scribbled on the stones at the time they were laid in place.  That puts the Great Pyramid's construction at a terminus ad quem of 2560 BCE.<br/><br/>Not only this, but bits of organic material have been found in the mortar used in construction.  This material is dated to nearly around the same time period, meaning that the Great Pyramid was not built in the Pleistocene but in historical times.</div>

			<div id="cm_776521">Kalopin, I am well acquainted with the fact that the sphinx predated Tuthmosis IV.  Were you aware that there is a subterranean chamber underground and connected with an underground causeway to the sphinx, and that this chamber also was a tomb? Some are referring to it as the tomb of Osiris.<br/><br/>So, of course the sphinx predated Tuthmosis IV.  So, what? Evidence of that excavation also shows that it was much later than the Pleistocene, although predating Tuthmosis IV.  No Atlantis, no Atlantean records hidden, no Pleistocene construction, no comet fragment impact, no meteor strike causing the 1811 earthquake and aftershocks.<br/><br/>Everything you believe in concerning all this is claptrap.  New pyramids? Maybe.  It would be very cool if so.  Other pyramids have already been excavated from their burials as well.  None date to the Pleistocene or show any evidence of being from such an epoch.  You need to learn how to read inscriptions, and you need chemistry, physics, and geology education, ASAP.</div>

The moon would not exist, either, except as dust in a planetary ring and there would have been no humans.

			<div id="cm_777376">So, it would appear that you are one of those Gayce/Atlantean Pyramid nutcakes.  Either that or your lithium carbonate levels are out of whack.  It also would seem that you failed at Geology and Physics.  Yes, the Appalachians were much higher than they now are.  What they are now are old, eroded mountains.  It took millions of years for that erosion to occur.<br/><br/>The Arsdale/Cox article is no joke and gives good explanation for what actually happened.  It is much more plausible for what happened there because there is hard geological evidence to support the hotspot theory (including eroded plutons, sediments, and lava tubes containing diamonds in all the right places), unlike with your null hypothesis, which has zero geological support.  When hotspots move, portions of the crust can sink, which is what happened to the Embayment.  Hawaii resulted from a hotspot.  Should it ever move the entire chain could sink below sea level.  That is Geology 101.  Same process.</div>

			<div id="cm_777943">There was no lunar impact. Had there been there would have been no humans to debate this ad hoc hypothesis of yours. The Embayment is the wrong direction for any kind of impact, lunar or otherwise, and all the evidence of what really happened is in the Embayment and the path of the Bermuda hotspot.<br/><br/>There will be NO history repeating itself with respect to Earth's moon. It is on trajectory AWAY from Earth, moving a few centimeters or so every year. THIS IS MEASURABLE. Not the trajectory of a moon that once was an impactor.<br/><br/>The only delusions we see here are the delusion that the moon impacted the Earth during the Pleistocene and left humans alive, that the 1812 earthquake was caused by meteorite strike, and the delusion that Hudson Bay was caused by a comet fragment strike and yet still left humanity alive.<br/><br/>I call BS on your "faults prove no hotspot heat" quip. There is a large fault northwest of the Hawaiian islands, and rift zones and small faults around Hawaii, like the Embayment.</div>

Why not use just real impact sites instead of making them up, if your sole point is to try to get humankind to find ways to defend against such impacts from space?<br/><br/>Impact force has not been overestimated. It can be and has been OBSERVED. The laws of physics apply as do centuries of observable data. But, you expect me to believe that everyone is out of step but Kalopin. Not going to happen. You have zero tangible data.<br/><br/>Plutons from the Moon left on Earth? Take geology courses, please. This has to have been one of the most ignorant statements you have made yet.<br/><br/>Erosion time of plutons depends upon kind of material and external forces involved in erosion. To erode plutons requires elevation above sea level into the erosive forces.<br/><br/>So far, the moon is pretty consistent in its movement away, each and every year--and this has been studied/documented.

Those of us who understand the subject matter aren't falling for it. If any of this had been in my curriculum, I would have sued to get my money back and gotten my education elsewhere.<br/><br/>An iron ball being subject to meteor impacts? Really??? It would still be an iron ball with dents. My point was that the Moon is composed of far more than you claimed because you misread the paper, as you do a lot. Chesapeake Bay and Chicxalub are the only real impacts you have talked about thus far. All others are fanciful, at best. The moon is composed of igneous rock because it came from Earth's mantle.<br/><br/>There was no lunar impact. Period. We know because the Moon still is there and isn't a ring of dust. We know this because humankind is still here. We know this because the Moon's orbit is fairly stable even though it gets further away each year, and no 1000 ' waves.</div>

Your null hypothesis of a moon impact also has one of several fatal flaws, not the least of which is that the Moon and Earth are going the wrong direction to support it!<br/><br/>You claim that the Moon glanced the Earth during the Pleistocene, pulling on the Arabian plate, gouging out the Mediterranean, and then touching down again in what would later become the US. The Moon is going the wrong direction for this to have happened even if it could have happened and both humans and the moon managed to survive it! Are you not even aware that the Earth turns anti-clockwise, as is the Moon's orbit?<br/><br/>If the moon did gouge out the Mediterranean it would have pushed the Arabian plate and forced it in the way of the Indian plate, preventing the uprising of the Himalayas.

			<div id="cm_779836">What I'd like to hear from Kalopin is how he figures that the Moon managed to lift back up into space when its orbital velocity is nowhere near escape velocity from Earth (assuming it could even survive multiple trips to within the Roche limit much less surface brushes/oblique impacts).  Did it bounce like a billiard ball even with pangaea?<br/><br/>Why is the Moon still 1:1 tidally locked with Earth? If it made contact at the disparate speeds between rotation of Earth and orbital velocity of the Moon, it should not be 1:1 tidally locked as it now is.<br/><br/>And, when will there be another alleged "pangaea imbalance" that gravitationally will pull the moon back down again into brushes with Earth so as to be worth worrying about?<br/><br/>No matter how much I try I cannot put the pieces together to make anything Kalopin postulates work.  Everything falls apart on even simple analysis.  There are too many fatal flaws to move even from hypothesis to theory. Ad hoc, null hypotheses are all I see thus far.</div>

My proposed craters are much more obvious than most craters, especially those two!<br/><br/>just to straighten facts- YES, the Moon IS going in the correct direction for this impact! It comes in from the east, the Earth turns toward the west. It did not 'pull' on the Arabian plate, This impact caused Africa to push the Arabian plate hard against the Eurasian plate, then tectonic rebound caused the African plate to try and fill in the crater, forcing up the Alps.<br/><br/>The Moon released its plasma at the Black sea and impacted east Mediterranean, it did not impact over where the continental U.S. was at the time, as that was the land that was pushed westward.<br/><br/>Do you believe the Moon would just stick? It has its own limit, it bent an entire tectonic plate inward, this release of pressure was enough to send the Moon into a further and more stable orbit. Water weight distribution?</div>

			<div id="cm_780004">The Indian plate was beneath the Arabian plate on the east side of Africa. This impact IS the mechanism that pushed the Indian plate upward, against the direction of oceanic currents and against the rotation of the planet, at such an high enough rate to smash into Asia to raise the Himalayas, and, as I have previously stated, there is NO other mechanism available to create such an outcome. Please tell everyone what is commonly accepted to cause this event!<br/><br/>Australia was thrown out to the east and Antarctica was spun out to the south. This, along with the comet forcing Greenland toward the northeast, I believe was imperitive to create a more stable environment and a more balanced orbital path.<br/><br/>It is now the melting ice that may disrupt orbital elements, causing an electromagnetic and physical imbalance to force another near Earth object impact. The Moon is sensitive to these changes and will adjust its orbit accordingly. It is a harmonic balncer.<br/><br/>forcing false beliefs?-who is?;-]]]]]</div>

			<div id="cm_780106">If the moon were the cause of the sudden push of the Indian plate northward, there would be no enclosed Mediterranean Sea. It would have ripped through and left it open on the east.  What is more, the Moon would not be 1:1 tidally locked as it now is. The rotation of the earth would have altered the Moon's rotation to a retrograde motion. The fact that the Moon's rotation is not retrograde but is prograde also is another fatal flaw in your null hypothesis.<br/><br/>It also would have pushed the Eurasian plate against the North American plate and African plate against the southern portion of the North American plate. But, what do we see? We see divergent plate movement with these plates moving away from each other rather than being pushed into each other. Your null hypothesis violates all sorts of laws of physics and so forth.<br/><br/>We have been showing you your errors but you will not listen to reason because you are incapable of even seeing reason. It's become a religion of sorts for you.</div>

			<div id="cm_780286">Got some time so wanted to comment more on the inscription. The Abydos inscription is read from right to left. First, I translate the unaltered hieroglyphics of the usurped inscription. At the very right are the characters for "Two Ladies." At the very left are the characters for "Son of Re'." In the middle: "Dual King, Lord of the Twin Lands." Some would translate "dual king" as "King of lower and upper Egypt"; I prefer "Dual King."  No need for the usurper to alter these characters; they're common.<br/><br/>Next, the original name in the inscription (between "Dual King" and "Son of Re'") was Menmaatre (Seti I).  The inscription was overwritten with Usermaatre-setepenre (Ramesses II).<br/><br/>The inscription after "Two Ladies" is difficult to make out with the covering plaster missing but was altered from "who subjugates the nine bows" to "who suppresses the nine foreign countries." These are the "Two Ladies" or "Nebty" names of usurped and usurper interposed. No flying machines to see here, folks.</div>

Working with the 1000 character limit also made it necessary to omit some words from the full Nebty names until the next post in order to preserve logical units of thought.  I found a photo that shows how the two names overlap.  The photo is correct.  However, since the links to the photos contain plus signs, the links would be broken.  So, here is the link to the webpage containing the photos for people to consult for themselves.  Readers will find the fuller Nebty names on this page.<br/><br/><a href="http://raincool.blogspot.com/2010/05/helicopter-hieroglyphs-explained.html" title="http://raincool.blogspot.com/2010/05/helicopter-hieroglyphs-explained.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://raincool.b...ned.html</a><br/><br/>I also wanted to offer a minor correction and clarify that on closer inspection that the "Two Ladies" characters were also part of the alteration on the extant portion of the inscription.  I needed better photos to see that clearly and the photos on the blog link are clearer than those I was working with a few minutes ago. Definitely overlap.</div>

			<div id="cm_780412">Lots and lots of claptrap in that link you gave. There is nothing logical about this page's portrayal of the inscription. I have looked at really good photos of this inscription, from multiple sources.<br/><br/>Yes, I will state that the Abydos inscription in question has been rewritten once, and the previous inscription remnants were filled in with plaster by the usurper of the inscription. However, contrary to your view, most of the plaster has fallen completely out, leaving pretty much just the stonework. I see only two inscriptions interposed.<br/><br/>Both inscriptions are ancient and neither are from the Pleistocene. Both persons named in the mixed inscription are known historical persons. There is no mystery about the inscription.<br/><br/>Plus, there are other inscriptions at Abydos that also help to put the lie to the flying machine shown in inscription hypothesis. There is zero evidence that those who found the inscription themselves did anything to the inscription at Abydos. It is as they found it.</div>

Two known historical personalities built the temple containing the Abydos inscription. It was started by Seti I and finished by Ramesses II. Both of their names are stated as being involved. Ramesses II usurped the inscription debated because he finished the work and the temple.<br/><br/>Neither of these persons dates to the Pleistocene. Period. Only claptrap religionists would believe that that temple was constructed during the Pleistocene or that it really does depict flying machines when the mechanism for usurping inscriptions is known and the two individuals in the inscription both are known.<br/><br/>Karnak's Temple of Amon-Ra also was built in historical times. The names of the builders of elements therein were all historical persons. That last site was really funny with flying pyramids depicted. Claptrap. Show me the Karnak inscription.</div>

			<div id="cm_780961">As to denial about mountain ranges and no tangible evidence, that is entirely untrue. The remains of the ancient mountains are right there, and the mechanism is known. That is why Plate tectonics are considered Theory and your hypotheses will never leave hypothetical and become theoretical.<br/><br/>In point of fact, we can observe the forces that make mountains at work today by monitoring the movements of tectonic plates using GIS, GPS, and other modern technologies.<br/><br/>We also can replicate the processes involved both with computer and with practical models. The evidence of Pangaea is there, and that the positioning of the plates into that configuration would have created mountain ranges at several crucial points, the remnants of one mountain range surviving to the present in the Appalachians and Ouachita mountains.<br/><br/>The Indian plate still is pressing into and subducting under the Eurasian plate, causing the Himalayas to grow around 6.1 cm every year.

The standard models, on the other hand, fully explain and account for the Moon's 1:1 tidal locking and current prograde orbit.<br/><br/>What is more, I ran a few examples on the Purdue "Impact:Earth!" site and found no scenario wherein humankind could survive either the shockwave or the starvation from the trees being stripped to the trunks (vegetation would be ripped from ground). Even from 20,000 km away, the winds resulting from the shock wave from a moon-sized impactor at even 1 degree inclination to ground would exceed a maximum wind velocity of 9,000 mph. Serious land slides would have resulted all over that would have covered and suffocated to death humans hiding in caves, never mind the numbers of humans sandblasted to death on the surface.

			<div id="cm_781402">Prograde rotation is the expected direction for the Moon. Retrograde rotation is what would have resulted had the Moon survived entry into the Roche limit multiple times. The Earth is rotating in a prograde rotation, or anti-clockwise. The rotation velocity of the Earth at the equator is 1,070 mph. If the Moon hit the Earth and skidded across the Earth for 2,400-plus miles, the friction would have reversed the rotation direction of the Moon to retrograde, or clockwise. The Moon, however, is spinning prograde, as the standard models dictate it should.<br/><br/>Please do be specific and detailed as to which variables are not covered on the Impact site.<br/><br/>I would love for the Egyptians to have had technologies like those we use today but there is zero evidence for any of it, just crank info written by those who don't know better and can't read Egyptian.<br/><br/>There is evidence in the geology of the region.

			<div id="cm_781483">Sure is looking that way, Captain Stumpy.  Funny thing is, the Dendera "lightbulb" is supposed to be this advanced technology rendering use of torches unnecessary in Egyptian temples, and yet the very same Temple of Hathor where this alleged light bulb is depicted had hundreds of years of soot obscuring a previously unknown mural on the ceiling.  If they had light bulbs, why the need for hundreds of years of torches. Yep, the reptilians took all the light bulbs with them, forcing them to use torches for hundreds of years.<br/><br/>Worse for Kalopin and others like him, we know the mythology behind the symbols.  It's no light bulb.  It's a depiction of the serpent form of Atum coming forth from the lotus in an air bubble as the first act of creation from nothingness! It actually is a serpent in the depiction, not a bulb filament. But, Kalopin would ignore Egyptian mythology and make up/believe modern mythologies of his and others' creation rather than understand or read what Egyptians thought.</div>

The standard models explain quite well what we see and what we are currently observing. Remember, real science starts and ends with observation and replication.<br/><br/>Looking again at the sarcophagus, I see stylized elements of Maya mythology. There is no rocket ship there as the Ancient Aliens crowd claims. You are like the people who claim a macaw is an elephant in Maya artwork depicting stylized macaws. Religious crankism at its finest!<br/><br/>Show me some pretty pictures of ejecta and limestone rock embedded in anything Maya. You still haven't shown me the Karnak inscription so I expect you'll not provide meltrock photos, either. By the way, I tried to obtain photos of the Karnak inscription from the newspaper.  Al-Sharq, etc., doesn't exist. Asharq, etc., does exist and there were no photos nor article to obtain.  It appears you have been punked.</div>

			<div id="cm_782392">The moon rolling about? Electromagnetic attraction and repulsion without electromagnets? I know that if a moon or other object with low tensile strength enters the Roche limit of earth's gravity well it breaks apart into dust. Moons don't create topography on a planet. Show me any legitimate evidence that any do. Topography is a function of geological and weather/climate-based erosion processes within that geological mechanism.<br/><br/>I have seen zero evidence and nothing but religious crankism from you so far. Natural course of planet formation? Really??? What about the planets that have no moons?<br/><br/>I have been giving this study and have been coming to the conclusion that just about everything that you have presented thus far is nothing but crank, claptrap and little to no valid, observable science.</div>

It wasn't mysticism but hard work, this is how Ed really accomplished the massive project.... </blockquote><br/><br/>The above article also states:<br/><blockquote> For decades, the park featured a perfectly balanced stone gate that, despite its weight, would easily swing open with a strong breeze or the push of a finger. How it worked remained a mystery until 1986 when it stopped moving. When the gate was removed it was revealed that it rotated on a metal shaft and rested on a truck bearing.... Though the quarried stone slabs are large, they are actually lighter than they appear because the rock is porous. </blockquote><br/><br/>So much for the mystery...

In fact, we all have gotten a glimpse of what can happen with mere fragments of comets crashing into a planet! Impacts were observed by astronomers all over the world! Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke up into at least 21 fragments, each fragment up to 2 kilometers across, which then pelted Jupiter at 60 km/s. Here is video of several impacts:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiLNxZbpP20" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiLNxZbpP20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.youtub...NxZbpP20</a><br/><br/>The following composite photo shows what the blast radius of just a small fragment of Shoemaker-Levy 9 would have been had it hit Earth:<br/><br/><a href="http://emeraldtech.biz/DrDB/Impact_Earth.gif" title="http://emeraldtech.biz/DrDB/Impact_Earth.gif" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://emeraldtec...arth.gif</a><br/><br/>Yes, we know what an actual comet collision could do. Anything written before the observed impacts were unknowns, theories, and hypotheses.  We now know what comet impacts would do because comet impacts have now been observed on another world and we now can extrapolate that data and its effects on Earth.<br/><br/>The rest of your comment is laded w/ crank.</div>

You do not have science on your side, which is why you believe crankism and make it a religion of sorts.<br/><br/>By the way, what exactly is mankind supposed to do to stop a comet from blasting the planet? Collectively don tinfoil caps and hum "aum" at the right frequency to repel the comet and prevent the "electromagnetic harmonic balancing" of the moon?!? Nonsense!<br/><br/>Claptrap, just about all that you post...</div>

			<div id="cm_783187">My bad. What you actually wrote was:<br/><blockquote>    it is not understood that comets can disrupt and push massive amounts of cosmic rays out in different directions.    </blockquote><br/><br/>Still claptrap. Cosmic rays come in from all directions outside the solar system. Comets are too small to disrupt them and are not on the same plane of the ecliptic as Earth. The Moon once a comet? Yet more claptrap! I thought you said that it was an iron ball. Comets are supernova shrapnel? More claptrap and pseudoscience. Some are just faster asteroids??? Even more claptrap and pseudoscience.<br/><br/>Passing the sound barrier??? In what? Dense Aether? Yet another crank hypothesis. Don't you know that sound barriers are only applicable to things that can generate sound? Sound requires a medium in which to travel and propagate. There is no medium in space, space being vacuum and all. Sonic booms require atmosphere and don't cause earthquakes! Kalopins' legacy will be to be a laughingstock and to pass away into obscurity.</div>

			<div id="cm_784372">Do you remember the experiment that was done during a total solar eclipse in order to try to see whether any high energy cosmic rays came from the sun? Do you? I doubt it. The results showed that these cosmic rays did not come from the Sun. Had they come from the Sun, they would have been in large part stopped and deflected in large part by the Moon. But, it isn't what happened. Earth continued to be bombarded by cosmic rays in the same levels as before the solar eclipse. If you aren't familiar with the experiment you should do some research and look it up.<br/><br/>Artifacts are put into context by examination and testing, including dating using tree rings. You keep attacking carbon dating but you seem unaware that your beloved tree rings used in dendrochronology are used to correlate and support the accuracy of carbon dating, and vice versa. Because of the combined technologies, we can date organic objects to an accuracy of 25 years. Ancient mortar contains organics. No Pleistocene pyramids.</div>

The Earth is slightly older than the Moon, and the Moon originated from the Earth, as isotopic and chemical analyses have shown. This is consistent with an impact that resulted in the components that later became the Moon. Different planets have differing isotopic ratios. The Moon has virtually the same isotopic signature of Earth, with what looks to be from the impactor that created the earth's Moon from the Earth's mantle. Chemically, the rocks of the Moon are like those of the Earth's mantle. Comets do not have enough mass to push radiation from the Sun much less from other stars.

The Moon is more massive than our atmosphere, so yes, it could block solar radiation if the Sun indeed were the source of high energy cosmic radiation. It isn't. Tecumseh crater? Did you make that name up? What does everyone else call it?<br/><br/>I did examine the layout of the Embayment. It fits the profile that geological processes explain.

			<div id="cm_784519">Finally, yes dendrochronology needs verification as does carbon dating. The beauty of it is that each corrects the other to make the dating more precise. Why is it needed? It is because certain climate and weather phenomena actually can cause a tree to miss rings as well as grow extra rings per year. You did not know that? Not surprised.<br/><br/>So, what scientists do is examine the isotope ratios and presence of C14 to determine which multiple tree rings belong to the same year. Thus, carbon dating corrects dendrochronology and dendrochronology helps to correct C14 dating.<br/><br/>How indeed! The Moon collects differing isotope ratios in certain elements once separated from earth. That's how. Chemical analyses are hard science, not bull. The Moon has not collided with Earth multiple times, or even once. There is zero geological evidence of that. Comets are of differing masses but none ever the size of Earth's Moon. Zero evidence. Satellite photos tainted w/ optical illusions. Definitely not better.</div>

			<div id="cm_784717">For dating non-organic items you need to use a differing form of dating. Carbon dating is only good for a maximum of about 50,000 years. True petrified wood is non-organic but one must use care in what type of dating to use or you will get wrong results. One has to be careful to use the right dating, or you could be dating the age of the minerals themselves rather than the organics, if any be present. Dendrochonologically corrected and confirmed carbon dating is quite accurate, on the other hand, as is carbon-corrected dendrochronology.<br/><br/>Nope. The Embayment, Hudson Bay, and Mediterranean are not 'astroblemes' but geological formations from geological processes over long periods of time. There is zero physical evidence of any of these being 'astroblemes' in decades of searching.<br/><br/>Which two volcanoes, again? You do know that a very large earthquake preceded by long-term erosion will cause the same kind of collapse event, don't you? No? I'm not surprised, really. No meteor impact in 1811.</div>

			<div id="cm_784777">First, your "how big" question. The quake can be big enough as the one associated with an eruption of Mt. St. Helens, which was accompanied by an earthquake 5.1 on the RIchter scale that partially collapsed its own caldera.<br/><br/><a href="http://volcaniccollapse.wordpress.com/" title="http://volcaniccollapse.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://volcanicco...ess.com/</a><br/><br/>That was 5.1 on the Richter scale. The New Madrid quake was much stronger. I am by no means surprised by the fact that a couple ancient calderas collapsed in the area of that fault system.<br/><br/>And, you can look at a total solar eclipse. You just do not want to look at the sun before totality.  <a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/safety2.html" title="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/safety2.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://eclipse.gs...ty2.html</a><br/><br/>You seriously need to learn to comprehend what you read. I think you would not be misled by so much crank out there if you did and could. And, before I answer your question relative to the mass of the moon vs. the mass of Earth's atmosphere, and post links, I must ask you a question.

Yes, this thread is supposed to be about Egyptians using water, etc., but a science crank diverted from the topic and added claims about gravity being different because of a lunar impact, Pleistocene pyramids, etc, etc, etc.<br/><br/>How do we know it was water? It is because a number of inscriptions actually say things like "pouring water" or "the overseer pouring water" above or to the side of the person pouring liquid, and so forth. Egyptians in the quarries still use the same methodologies as the ancient Egyptians, and still pour water to aid in dragging stones on wooden sledges using the action of the water on the stone dust resulting from quarrying. It results in less friction when pulling the stones, requiring fewer people to do the work of pulling the stone blocks.<br/><br/>Back to what I was doing...</div>

You were answered on that point and it would seem that it is you who are confused since you now cannot seem to remember even asking that question. If you want to be better understood, perhaps you should frame your questions in better English.

			<div id="cm_785029">As to dating when something separated from another object, another type of dating can be used because of the accumulation of certain elements.  This is called cosmic-ray exposure age.  It also can be used to date moon rocks for various purposes. The main isotopes that are added to the samples over time are helium-3, neon-21, and argon-38, and used for dating but other isotopes are also created over time and exposure. The oldest rock samples taken from the Moon are on the order of 4.5 billion years old. The earth is 4.6 billion years old. Crystallization dating also is used with other isotopes to determine when the surface of the Moon crystallized. This information is consonant and consistent with the impact hypothesis of the Moon's formation. Other supports to that hypothesis can be seen here:<br/><a href="http://www.psi.edu/epo/moon/moon.html" title="http://www.psi.edu/epo/moon/moon.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.psi.ed...oon.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/310/5754/1671" title="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/310/5754/1671" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scienc...754/1671</a></div>

			<div id="cm_785041">Yes, it would be a waste of beer just to pull stones from the quarry. At times they did pour beer, but then the inscription usually says that they poured beer when they did it. In that case, however, it was an offering and not considered a waste of good beer for that situation since they considered that whatever was done to the votive statues would confer the essence of the beer and be of benefit to the god, goddess, or deceased.<br/><br/>That's what they believed, anyway, and it was the primary reason why they went to so much trouble whenever an important person or even a family member died. If you had money and social stature, you got honors, a book of spells, names, and passwords, to help you get through the trials and guarded gates that led to the afterlife, plus an expensive burial in an expensive tomb, pyramid or otherwise. If you didn't have these, you got buried in the fetal position in the desert, with a few of your personal possessions. Both accomplished the same--body preservation.</div>

			<div id="cm_785059">Happy day! Looks like decent photos of the Pakal's sarcophagus lid, both the surface and the inscription on the side of the lid, have been made available from the following locations.<br/><br/><a href="http://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/323/flashcards/169323/jpg/sarcophagus_lid1323819147799.jpg" title="http://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/323/flashcards/169323/jpg/sarcophagus_lid1323819147799.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://classconne...7799.jpg</a><br/><br/><a href="http://mayantrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Pakals-Actual-Tomb.jpg" title="http://mayantrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Pakals-Actual-Tomb.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mayantrip....Tomb.jpg</a><br/><br/>Yes, that indeed is the Maya depiction of the World Tree, otherwise known as the Ceiba. Wrapped around the branches indeed is the Vision Serpent. Pakal, the deceased, indeed is dressed like the Maize god of the Maya. And, ancestors of Pakal are depicted on the lid, too.<br/><br/>Like the above linked paper in the previous states, the image makes perfect sense of the inscriptions on the sarcophagus lid, and vice versa. Thus, we know there is no Pleistocene connection (note the recovered dates in the tomb inscriptions) and we also know that this tomb is that of an historical person in historical times, and no Maya rocketman launching into space.</div>

They pronounce it strictly a natural geological formation. I looked at the photos as well and will state that many examples of the same kinds of stone can be seen in locations all over the world. The joint, special report starts on page 8 of the following article:<br/><br/><a href="http://download.dailygrail.com/subrosa/SubRosa_Issue6-Single.pdf" title="http://download.dailygrail.com/subrosa/SubRosa_Issue6-Single.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://download.d...ngle.pdf</a><br/><br/>Notice the conclusion of the article, stating that New Age con man, Osmanagic (Ph.D. in sociology, not archaeology) and his crew, are deliberately attempting to carve out sections of the sedimentary rock to make it look like a classic, Mayan-style, step pyramid.  Truth needs no fraud to support it.

			<div id="cm_786583">It is not so much an issue of translation as it is an issue of typos in written text of the Italian article. There are a couple of apparent typos in the text. It does not take away from its validity all that much, however, in spite of a desire to see real problems where none exist.<br/><br/>Genetic modification and corn is well-known history. Even then, they thought it was the Maize god who did it when they got the final results (which, I believe, is the main reason for their reshaping their heads in honor of the Maize god). But, this genetic modification isn't modern genetic manipulation methodology or technology, no matter how much you want it to be so. It is no more than Mendelian Inheritance genetics, just as I stated earlier and does not make your point for you. If you cannot tell the difference between Mendelian genetics and modern genetic modification technology, you have yet another aspect of science to learn (but never will because the subject is inconvenient to your null hypotheses).</div>

			<div id="cm_786592">"Overlay carvings"??? Yet another null hypothesis. These carvings are original. And, where is the rocket now, if that really is what is depicted there? (The text itself says otherwise). Pakal get lost in space somewhere? It is ridiculous in the extreme to claim what you do. The texts can be read. This is particularly so in the case of most Egyptian texts. Egyptian had a regular history as a written and spoken language for over 5,000 years, the last Egyptian texts being written by Egyptians in the 1800s (Coptic, a form of written and spoken Egyptian). There is plenty of evidence as to written text but you are too ignorant to know of it or even weigh the evidence for yourself.<br/><br/>Even your updated link is so much claptrap. Every single photo shows natural formations that clearly can be seen in their "evidence." Schoch himself leans to the fringe, which is what makes it so funny for even him to attack the Bos. "pyramid." Too many pyramidiots in the world. Monks Mound is an earthwork. Learn.</div>

Nowhere. You have zero anecdotal evidence for your position. A "meteoric flash" is not the same thing as a "meteor strike." It is nothing more than a flash of light in the sky. Period. Plus, if there were a meteoric flash, there also would be no meteoric strike. The two terms are mutually exclusive because a meteoric flash generally is caused by a meteor exploding in the atmosphere and not reaching ground.<br/><br/>There also is zero physical evidence for a meteorite strike in the vicinity of the New Madrid fault in 1811. Please provide evidence for your claim that Memphis was named because of pyramids in the area. The Mississippian people were mound builders, not pyramid builders. There were no actual pyramids in Tennessee. By the way, Memphis was founded on May 22, 1819, by investors. You need to brush up on your history.</div>

For additional energy effect the Maya placed powerful quartz crystals at the top of the pyramids. Thus an additional energy field was created for those who needed energy to move through other spiritual dimensions or for healing purposes. </blockquote><br/><br/>Nothing says "crank" more eloquently than this!</div>

None existed before the Chinese figured out that mating those with more gold spots to another with gold spots will produce a fish with even more gold spots, and so forth. Same with teocinti -&gt; corn. That's very different from what we can do today. Mendelian inheritance genetics involves NO gene splicing. Today's genetic modification does. No accounts or physical remains of impacts.<br/><br/>Placement of rocks in Bosnia is natural. Every "structure" there I have seen in nature elsewhere. Even Mars has pyramidal geological structures formed naturally. The rest? Optical illusion.<br/><br/>BS on the Chickasaw nonsense. The Chickasaw say that they came from the West (and they aren't descendants of Mississippians, either).

Are you saying that Pakal isn't the person buried under the sarcophagus lid?<br/><br/>In the Egyptian inscription that pyramidiots think displays flying machines, it is one inscription overwriting another. But, both inscriptions (and there are only two) are from historical times.<br/><br/>Neither the Maya nor Egyptian inscriptions say anything about or depict flying machines of any kind. The inscriptions can be read and enough is known about the text and languages as to be certain that these inscription don't depict flying machines of any kind, and never did. Anyone who says otherwise is a crank who cannot read the inscriptions at all.<br/><br/>As to comets, it's the other way around. The more experience we gain the less we fear seeing them.

The process is intrusion through cracks in sand and rock during the Cretaceous, modified by geological processes. Many geological studies have been done on these formations. They conclude it's a natural formation. Recently, America Unearthed did an episode on the Texas rock wall. Verdict? Natural formation. A Magnetic Orientation survey also was done.

Yes, Pangaea broke apart slowly, just like it slowly formed over millions of years from previous tectonic processes. Pangaea originally was formed by continental plates drifting into each other.  There never was a single Pangaean plate. This is why you need to learn some real geology so that you can learn to actually understand the real evidence of the situation.</div>

			<div id="cm_788815">Corn was not invented by gene splicing. Period. Archaeological surveys have shown that corn became what it now is over a long period of time. Over time, additional varieties were made by crossing existing varieties. You seriously need to do some research on this matter to see the transition of size from teosinte to maize over a period of time. It was by no means an instantaneous feat. Much time and patience was required.<br/><br/>Your "spectacular" lights never reached ground, which is why they were lights.<br/><br/>You also misread the article I linked--rather badly I might add. Read it again, this time more carefully. There is a well-known process of determining ancestry of plants by crossing two species to get the original parent plants and ratios of gene distribution. That is what was done. It proved the process and archaeological finds back it up.<br/><br/>Very few in the Trail of Tears? Try 6,000 Chickasaw.

Bouis didn't create the golden rice, Potrykus and Beyer did. They did it by infecting rice with modified bacteria (something of which ancient peoples knew nothing about, not having microscopes capable of allowing humans to see them). Corn took much longer because it was a laborious process that was done completely manually, with crossing &amp; re-crossing of plants with the desired, visible traits.<br/><br/>They were lights because they never hit ground. They exploded in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Sound or pressure waves require a medium through which to act. There is no medium in the solar system dense enough to accomplish what your null hypothesis suggests. Interstellar gas, maybe (very slim to none in probability), but there's no interstellar gas in the solar system. It's mostly kept outside by the heliosphere.</div>

The majority of CaCO3 precipitates out of liquid because most of it isn't soluble in water. This is chemistry 101. I'm astounded at how scientifically ignorant you are. Giant capacitor? Claptrap.

Others described it as what looked like distant lightning to the southwest. Others described it as distant lightning from the northwest, or "flashes of lightning." Others denied that anyone except a very few in their locations claimed seeing any lights. "Flashes of fire...issuing from their sides" sounds like earthquake lights. One account contained debunking of a man claiming that earthquakes are caused by "this world and the moon coming in contact"! What I have noticed, so far, is that the accounts I have read say nothing about meteors falling from the sky (one said a fireball went from horizon to horizon over Pittsburg) and absolutely none say that they saw the comet, fragment, or meteor, actually hit the ground. The only ones who say anything about the comet were guessing. If there were meteors hitting ground somebody would have seen it.</div>

Your hypothesis is nothing but an ad hoc, null hypothesis.<br/><br/>You misunderstood the link you provided--yet again. No surprise there. What is the difference between a supersaturated solution and a solid? And, it was a computer simulation for part of the study. You have some learning to do.<br/><br/>That's what I said--the 15,000 were intruders. You cited the page as part of your argument to me. But, as I also stated, you also misread that link. Chickasaw did serve honorably and fight in the War of 1812. <a href="http://www.chickasaw.tv/history-timeline/document/the-war-of-1812" title="http://www.chickasaw.tv/history-timeline/document/the-war-of-1812" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.chicka...-of-1812</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/history-of-the-choctaw-and-chickasaw-in-indian-territory.htm" title="http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/history-of-the-choctaw-and-chickasaw-in-indian-territory.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.access...tory.htm</a><br/><br/>New Madrid was the nearest the quake epicenter. Do you understand epicenter? New Madridcontinued. An impact that killed 20,000 people would leave substantial physical evidence. There is zero physical evidence of impact/no impact eyewitness accounts.</div>

I show how Chickasaw warriors fought in the Red Stick faction and the War of 1812 and you post a speech of Tecumseh in 1811, in reply. Yes, that is the historical method, now isn't it? Not! You're calling the Chickasaw liars! Pathetic...<br/><br/>Do you know the difference between base and acid? Between NaHCO3 and CaCO3? Nope! Everything you post shows how much you don't know or understand much of reality, much less anything about the sciences you profess to understand. The worst thing is that you are so clueless that you are clueless about being clueless about science and history. That is really sad and a testament to the consequences of dropping out of school.<br/><br/>New Madrid originally was Spanish territory; they invited many English to migrate and settle there. They did, and the territory later became French but the inhabitants of New Madrid remained English.</div>

			<div id="cm_789631">You don't even know the meaning of epicenter! New Madrid right near the epicenter of the New Madrid Earthquakes of 1811-1812. That's the center of locus and action during an earthquake. That is where the impact would have occurred. An impact large enough to vaporize 20,000 people in sparsely populated territory would have left a great deal of evidence. No such evidence ever has been found and many people have been looking for evidence for decades.<br/><br/>New Madrid and all its inhabitants also would have been obliterated with all its people in such a blast. Yet, almost the entire town survived and people sent in eyewitness accounts! Not one eyewitness account says that a large impactor came in from the sky and hit ground. None!<br/><br/>You are so wrapped up in your crank that you cannot seem to be able to tell whether the Moon carved out the Embayment or a comet/meteor. There is no shockwave pattern there except in your imagination. You remind me of Velikovsky when Einstein explained things to him.</div>
