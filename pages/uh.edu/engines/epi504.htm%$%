            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Today, a witch doctor practices computer
                arithmetic. The University of Houston's College of
                Engineering presents this series about the machines
                that make our civilization run, and the people
                whose ingenuity created them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <font size="+3">T</font>he scene is a remote
                Ethiopian village in 1940. A Farmer offers his herd
                of 34 goats for sale. One goat is worth, say $7.
                The villagers don't know how to multiply, so they
                call in a shaman. They ask him to set a fair price
                for the whole herd.
              </p>
              <p>
                The shaman digs two rows of small holes in the hard
                dry earth. He reaches into his sack of pebbles and
                goes to work. He puts 34 stones in the first hole
                on the left -- one for each goat. He puts half
                that, or 17, in the next -- half 17, or 8, in the
                next -- and so on. He keeps dividing by two and
                dropping the remainder, until the sixth hole has
                only one stone in it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now he goes to the other row. He puts 7 stones --
                the value of one goat -- in the first hole. He puts
                twice that, or 14 stones in the next hole, and so
                on. Now his deliberations begin.
              </p>
              <p>
                He goes down the left-hand side, seeing whether the
                holes are good or evil. An even number of stones
                makes the hole evil. An odd number makes it good.
                Two holes are good. The holes next to them, in the
                right row, contain 14 stones and 224 stones. He
                adds those numbers together. The result is the fair
                market value of the herd. It's $238.
              </p>
              <p>
                You and I know about multiplication. So we multiply
                the number of sheep, by the value of a sheep -- 7
                times 34. When we do that, we get $238. But that's
                just what the shaman got! So what in the world was
                all the business with the holes? And would he get
                the right answer with different numbers?
              </p>
              <p>
                We try it with other numbers. It works every time.
                So we turn to a mathematician. He says it's not at
                all obvious. He puzzles for a long time. Finally he
                sees it. This Ethiopian shaman has created a
                remarkable algorithm.
              </p>
              <p>
                All that business with the holes identifies the
                numbers in their binary form. That lets the shaman
                reduce multiplication to simple addition. He's
                multiplied just the way a digital computer does.
                Where did his method come from? How long have his
                forbears carried this rote tradition?
              </p>
              <p>
                An anonymous genius lurks somewhere in the haze of
                his history. So we look at our own multiplication
                and realize that we too use ritual to find what 7
                times 34 is. It makes no more sense to most people
                who use it than the shaman's holes. Our
                multiplication algorithm was also given us by an
                anonymous genius. He is also lost in rote
                tradition.
              </p>
              <p>
                So how do we and that Ethiopian shaman differ? Very
                little, I reckon. Very little indeed. Of course, I
                wouldn't be surprised if he makes fewer mistakes
                than we do.
              </p>
