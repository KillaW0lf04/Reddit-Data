(This one is kind of technical, sorry.)<P>

We're working on this computer game called Terra Nova, where you run
around outside in powered battle armor with your squadmates beating
people up.<P>

One guy on the team is a junior programmer, who is a fine guy and an
okay coder, but whose coding style isn't all that 'mature', as we say
in the business -- the code often isn't very elegant or robust.<P>

Anyway, he's working on this system for displaying data about your
powered battle armor.  There's a little 3-digit LED that shows the
suit's temperature, and he's putting the temperature into string form
for displaying there.  So his code looks something like this:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
temp_to_str (int temp)
{
  char str[4];
  sprintf (str, "%d", temp);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

and so forth.<P>

I tell him, "Hey, this is no good, because if the temperature ever
goes over 1000 (or under -100), you'll overflow your string and the
game will just totally crash without warning."<P>

He says, "Oh yeah, okay, whatever, I'll fix it."<P>

So I look back at the code a couple days later, to make sure that
he's fixed it, and he has indeed changed the code. It now looks like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
temp_to_str (int temp)
{
  char str[4];
  if (temp <= -100 || temp >= 1000)
    fprintf (stderr, "WARNING: PROGRAM IS ABOUT TO CRASH!\n");
  sprintf (str, "%d", temp);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
