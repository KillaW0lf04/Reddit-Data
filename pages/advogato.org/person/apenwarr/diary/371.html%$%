<p><b>2008-01-31: Git is the next Unix</b></p>
<p>When I first heard about <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>, I&#13;
was suspicious that there could be anything special about it, but after&#13;
watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">Linus'&#13;
talk about it</a>, I was... even more suspicious.  I tried it anyway.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
When I tried it, I realized something right away: what made git awesome was&#13;
actually none of the things Linus had talked about, not really.  Those&#13;
things were more like... symptoms of the underlying awesomeness.  Yes, git&#13;
is fast.  Yes, it is distributed.  Yes, it is definitely not CVS.  Those&#13;
things are all great, but they miss the point.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
What actually matters is that <b>git is a totally new way to operate on&#13;
data</b>.  It changes the game.  git has been described as "concept-heavy",&#13;
because it does so many things so differently from everything else.  After&#13;
some reflection, I realized that this is far truer than I could see at&#13;
first.  git's concepts are not only unusual, they're revolutionary.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Come on, revolutionary?  It's just a version control system!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Actually it's not.  Git was originally <b>not</b> a version control&#13;
system; it was designed to be the <b>infrastructure</b> so that someone &#13;
else&#13;
could build one on top.  And they did; nowadays there are more than 100&#13;
git-* commands installed along with git.  It's scary and confusing and&#13;
weird, but what that means is <b>git is a platform</b>.  It's a new set of&#13;
nouns and verbs that we never had before.  Having new nouns and verbs &#13;
means&#13;
we can invent entirely new things that we previously couldn't do.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Git is a new kind of filesystem, and it's faster than any filesystem I've&#13;
ever seen: <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/apenwarr/diary/369.html">git &#13;
checkout&#13;
is faster than cp -a</a>.  It even <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-&#13;&#10;fsck.html">has&#13;
fsck</a>.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Git stores revision history, and it stores it in less space than any system&#13;
I've ever seen or heard of.  Often, in less space than the original objects&#13;
themselves!&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Git uses rsync-style hash authentication on <b>everything</b>, as well as a&#13;
new "tree of hashes" arrangement I haven't seen before, to enforce security&#13;
and reliability in amazing ways that make the idea of "guaranteed identical&#13;
every time" not something to strive for, but something that's always&#13;
irrevocably built in.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Git names everything using globally unique identifiers that nobody else will&#13;
ever accidentally use, so that being distributed is suddenly trivial.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Git is actually the missing link that has prevented me from building the&#13;
things I've wanted to build in the past.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I wanted to build a <a href="http://www.luminal.org/wiki/index.php/FunFS/FunFS">distributed&#13;
filesystem</a>, but it was too much work.  Now it's basically been done...&#13;
in userspace, cross-platform.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
At NITI we built a <a href="http://www.nitix.com/technologies/technologies_idb.php">file backup&#13;
system</a> using what was a pretty clever data structure to speed up file&#13;
accesses.  But we never got around to implementing sub-file deltas, because&#13;
we couldn't figure out a structure that would do it both quickly and&#13;
space-efficiently.  With git, they did.  To build your own backup system&#13;
that's much better than ours, just store it in git instead.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
On top of our backup system we made a protocol for synchronizing changes&#13;
up to a remote repository.  Our protocol was sort of okay; git's is much&#13;
better, and it will surely improve a lot in the months ahead.  (Currently&#13;
git requires you to sync *everything* if you want to sync *anything*, but&#13;
that's an implementation restriction, not a design or protocol restriction. &#13;
See <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-&#13;&#10;clone.html">shallow&#13;
clones</a> for just the beginning of this.)&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Someone else I know built a <a href="http://www.contingencyworks.com/">hash-indexed backup &#13;
system</a> to&#13;
efficiently store incremental backups from a large number of systems on a&#13;
single set of disks.  Git does the same, only even better, and supports&#13;
sub-file deltas too.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
We made a diskless workstation platform called <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200311/ai_mark160846&#13;&#10;3376/pg_2">Expression&#13;
Desktop</a> (now very dead).  Knowing disks were cheap and getting &#13;
cheaper,&#13;
we wanted to make it "diskful" eventually, automatically syncing itself from&#13;
a central server... but able to guarantee that it matched the server's files&#13;
exactly.  We couldn't find a protocol to do it.  git is that protocol.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
I built a system on top of Nitix, called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/versabox/">Versabox</a>, that let you &#13;
install&#13;
a Linux system on top of a Nitix system without virtualization.  I wanted a&#13;
way to make it easy to install software into that Linux environment, then&#13;
repackage the entire thing as an all-in-one installer kit, but have the&#13;
archive contain both the original package and the new content; that way you&#13;
could upgrade either part without touching the other.  To do that I invented&#13;
a new file format and tool, called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/versabox/issues/detail?&#13;&#10;id=13">versatar</a>. &#13;
It works, and we use it at <a href="http://versabanq.com/">my new&#13;
company</a>.  But git would do it much better, and includes digital&#13;
signatures too for free.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Numerous people have written diff and merge systems for wikis; <a href="http://twiki.org/">TWiki</a> even uses RCS.  If they used git instead,&#13;
the repository would be tiny, and you could make a personal copy of the&#13;
entire wiki to take on the plane with you, then sync your changes back when&#13;
you're done.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
When Unix pipes were invented, suddenly it was trivially easy to do&#13;
something that used to be really hard: connect the output of one program to&#13;
the input of the next.  Pipes were the fundamental insight that shaped the&#13;
face of Unix.  Programs didn't have to be monolithic.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
With git, we've invented a new world where revision history, checksums, and&#13;
branches don't make your filesystem slower: they make it <b>faster</b>. &#13;
They don't make your data bigger: they make it <b>smaller</b>.  They don't&#13;
risk your data integrity; they <b>guarantee integrity</b>.  They don't&#13;
centralize your data in a big database; they <b>distribute</b> it peer to&#13;
peer.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Much like Unix itself, git's actual software doesn't matter; it's the file&#13;
format, the <i>concepts</i>, that change everything.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
Whether they're called git or not, some amazing things will come of this.&#13;
