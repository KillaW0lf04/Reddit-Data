I'm shocked at how often we put up with it. <strong>Here's just a <em>few</em> issues - </strong><a href="http://www.xkcd.com/1108"><strike><strong>literally</strong></strike></a><strong> off the top of my head - that I personally dealt with last week.</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>My iPhone 4s has 3 gigs of "OTHER" taking up space, according to iTunes. No one has any idea what other is and all the suggestions are to reset it completely or "delete and re-add your mail accounts." Seems like a problem to me when I have only 16 total gigs on the device! </li>    <li>The Windows Indexing Service on my desktop has been running for 3 straight days. The answer? Delete and rebuild the index. That only took a day. </li>    <li>I have 4 and sometimes 5 Contacts for every one Actual Human on my iPhone. I've linked them all, but duplicates still show up. </li>    <li>My iMessage has one guy who chats me and the message will show up in any one of <em>three </em>guys with the same name. Whenever he chats me I have to back out and see which "him" it is coming from. </li>    <li>I don't think Microsoft Outlook has ever "shut down cleanly." </li>    <li>The iCloud Photo stream is supposed to show the last 1000 pictures across all my iOS devices. Mine shows 734. Dunno why. The answer? Uninstall, reinstall, stop, start, restart. </li>    <li>Where's that email I sent you? Likely stuck in my Outlook Outbox. </li>    <li>Gmail is almost as slow as Outlook now. Word is I should check for rogue apps with access to my Gmail via OAuth. There are none.      <ul>       <li><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Yes, I know how OAuth works, I've implemented versions of the spec. A Gmail engineer suggested that perhaps other authenticated clients (GMVault, Boomerang, or IMAP clients, etc) were getting in line and forcing synchronous access to my Gmail account. <a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/05/gmail-has-become-unsuably-slow.html">Gabriel Weinberg has blogged about Gmail slowness</a> as well.</em> </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>I use Microsoft Lync (corporate chat) on my Desktops, two laptops, iPhone and iPad as well as in a VM or two. A few days back two of the Lync instances got into a virtual fight and started a loop where they'd log each other in and out declaring "you are logged into Lync from too many places." So basically, "Doctor, it hurts when I do this." "Don't do that." </li>    <li>Final Cut Pro crashes when you scroll too fast while saving. </li>    <li>My Calendar in Windows 8 is nothing but birthdays. Hundreds of useless duplicate birthdays of people I don't know. </li>    <li>iPhoto is utterly unusable with more than a few thousand photos. </li>    <li>Don't even get me started about iTunes. </li>    <li>And Skype. Everything about the Skype UI. Especially resizing columns in Skype on a Mac. </li>    <li>Google Chrome after version 19 or so changed the way it registers itself on Windows as the default browser and broke a half dozen apps (like Visual Studio) who look for specific registry keys that every other browser writes. </li>    <li>I should get an Xbox achievement for every time I press "Clear" in the iPhone notification window. </li>    <li>I've got two Microsoft Word documents that I wrote in Word that I can no longer open in Word as Word says "Those aren't Word documents." </li>    <li>Three of my favorite websites lock up IE9 regularly. Two lock up Chrome. I never remember which is which. </li>    <li>AdBlock stopped my Gmail for working for three days with JavaScript errors until I figured it out and added an exclusion. </li> </ul>  <p>All of this happened with a single week of actual work. There are likely a hundred more issues like this. Truly, it's death by a thousand paper cuts.</p>  <p>I work for Microsoft, have my personal life in Google, use Apple devices to access it and <em><strong>it all sucks</strong></em>. </p>  <h3>Alone or in a crowd, no one cares.</h3>  <p>Here's the worst part, I didn't spend any time on the phone with anyone about these issues. I didn't file bugs, send support tickets or email teams. Instead, I just Googled around and saw one of <strong>two</strong>  possible scenarios for each issue. </p>  <ol>   <li>No one has ever seen this issue. You're alone and no one cares. </li>    <li>Everyone has seen this issue. No one from the company believes everyone. You're with a crowd and no one cares. </li> </ol>  <p>Sadly, both of these scenarios ended in one feeling. Software doesn't work and no one cares.</p>  <h3>How do we fix it?</h3>  <p>Here we are in 2012 in a world of open standards on an open network, with angle brackets and curly braces flying at gigabit speeds and it's all a mess. Everyone sucks, equally and completely.</p>  <ul>   <li>Is this a speed problem? Are we feeling we have to develop too fast and loose? </li>    <li>Is it a quality issue? Have we forgotten the art and science of Software QA? </li>    <li>Is it a people problem? Are folks just not passionate about their software enough to fix it? </li>    <li><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It is a communication problem? Is it easy for users to report errors and annoyances? </li> </ul>  <p>I think it's all of the above. We need to care and we need the collective will to fix it. What do you think?</p>  <p>P.S. If you think I'm just whining, let me just say this. I'm am complaining not because it sucks, but because I KNOW we can do better.</p> <h3>Related Posts in this Three Part series on Software Quality</h3>

I'm yet to work within a single workplace which didn't have blatant problems with efficiency and direction due to various combinations of apathy &amp; incompetence. Because of the intellectual void between technical and non-technical folk, it seems that there are too many people working as IT professionals who clearly shouldn't be, but they are rarely caught out due to the 'black art' mentality amongst traditional business management hierarchies, who seem to be falling over themselves to look past blatant incompetence in IT which would never be tolerated in better understood industries.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d95dd40e8abf3c5e7315c2bb19b55dd5&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawkv9V3eEIH-hSeSFBesdH_kfmrLFWz3jlQ"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />David Kennedy</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="7f28f62c-8056-45b0-aa85-0ee338e8afd6"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 05:05:44 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Regarding your first problem: iPhone &quot;Other&quot; space hogs; have you checked the Usage in Settings-&gt;General ?<br />The report that pops up there will show the size of an app with it's added &quot;documents &amp; data&quot;, this might be the source of your huge &quot;Otherness&quot;. <br />As an example: I have a reddit reader called Alien blue that weighs in at 24.8Mb, however it is using an extra 97.6 Mb for what I can only assume are caches and downloaded images.

You can only QA so many cases in a lab. Once it hits the real world the Millions of users (of each of the services/devices/apps you mentioned will find crazy interactions that make everything fubar.<br /><br />Now it's all about triage and mitigation while still finding a way to plan new features for the next release. I got tired of all my Facebook friends showing up in my Windows Phone calendar (with alerts mind you) and found how to turn it off (somewhere in your Windows Live account settings) but still haven't bothered to do so when I upgraded to the Lumia 900 (30 days to the day before MSFT announced it won't support Windows Phone 8).<br /><br />It's not that no one cares...it's about whom does this edge case affect? .5% of our users? Maybe that's worth looking at. Workaround in place? fuhgetaboutit. <br /><br />It makes the open source model a little more attractive no?

A few the pop to mind...<br /><br />Many large enterprises have so much division of labor in the process of software development. The people that decide what should be delivered by R&amp;D base it on revenue prospects...and fixing old features doesn't drive revenue so if you have the lead in the market there is little motivation to improve usability, general user experience, or even underlying code quality if it is &quot;good enough&quot; and &quot;selling&quot;. Sad but true. <br /><br />Eventually, the large enterprise can use up their goodwill and a new company can displace them by caring more, but it takes years and it is risky so a small business is less likely to take on the lion, rather go to blue ocean opportunities. <br /><br />In some industries, software vendors that have been there for decades (think cobol) are still selling their crappy old &quot;good enough&quot; solutions because new software is so complex for some customers they would rather stick to what they know. You or I rarely see this in the network we run in because those people adopt latest and greatest but so many cannot, still.<br /><br />The apathy for user experience is a very sad thing to me...because a happy customer will stay with your through thick and thin if they feel like you care enough. How much does the crappy iTunes interface show how Apple cares about the people making purchases? It is horrendous.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=bd80b2b7ff73b0c62ed2d2f001eb6436&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.michelelerouxbustamante.com">Michele Leroux Bustamante</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="d11207b4-2db1-46f2-8de9-a82a33138024"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 05:21:32 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">About &quot;...rogue apps with access to my Gmail via OAuth.

Exceptionalism and good service seem to have long fallen by the wayside for most businesses and especially for big corporations. <br /><br />You see this especially for software companies and how hard it is to even submit a bug report. Ever try to submit a bug report for any Office app? It's amazingly hard to find any place to put this info. All you're left with is forums. Google - you can't ever get a human for anything. Try finding any sort of support link other than forums on Google's sites anywhere. Support links point to FAQs, point to forums, point to FAQ and so on. The only way I can interpret that is that clearly they don't give a shit if things don't work or what their customers think. I've had a number of unresolved issues with Adsense with Google and NEVER EVER have gotten anybody to answer my questions on forums or otherwise...<br /><br />And worst of all it's become the norm, so that nobody can really complain because the alternative is - well often there's no better alternative. You can get the same shitty service from some other company. So, basically it's put up or shut up.<br /><br />The other issue is complexity of our society in general. We continue to build more and more complexity that depends on other already complex systems. We are achieving amazing things with technology (and not just computer related but also infrastructure, machinery etc.), but I also think that all this interaction of component pieces that nobody controls completely are causing side effects that can in many cases not be tested completely or successfully, resulting in the oddball interaction failures that you see (among other things). The stuff we use today is amazingly complex and I sometimes honestly wonder how any of it works at all. What we can do is pretty amazing... but all that complexity comes with a price of some 'instability'.<br /><br />I often wonder whether we really are better off now than we were before 30+ years ago when computers took over our lives. We have so much more access to - everything, but it's also making our lives so much more complex and stressful and taken up with problems we never had back then. Every time we fix a computer problem you're effectively wasting time - you're not doing anything productive, we're throwing away valuable time that could be spent doing something productive or just enjoying life.<br /><br />And then I go on back to my computer and hack away all night figuring out complex stuff. Yeah I'm a hypocrite too :-)</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=beb7fdd4bcd15e35472a96ab8182f034&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://rickstrahl.myopenid.com/"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />Rick</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="d9641289-4886-442f-b0d3-8015541e461a"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 06:21:43 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I see two main reasons for bad software: <br /><br />1.

I fell in love, and am now getting my masters degree in Software Development at QUT in Australia.  I never fully understood the concept of ignorance is bliss until I started studying User Interaction design.  Things like the Skype and iTunes UIs frustrated me before, but it never occurred to me that they could be changed.  Now, spending so much of my time working with human cognition, learning, memory and how it impacts the design of software makes it difficult for me to turn on my laptop without wincing. Particularly when you like 10,000 miles from home, I rely heavily on Skype and GMail to stay in contact with my family. When these things don't work, it has a direct impact on so many people's lives. If my 92-year-old grandmother doesn't know how to find a contact on skype, she can't call me.  While I am very new at designing software, it seems like a worthy goal to remember that human beings are the ones who have to use it, and no matter how interesting or funky my code may be, if it doesn't translate into something usable, it's utterly worthless. </div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f4fb82e43aa9d87886e313b2afb81d3&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawkJ9sh3ayXV-cJgKwuJJvfTajdIQJ2PBOQ"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />Kat Reiner</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="341f9413-e644-4c6c-8a79-2a8099566dee"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 08:06:42 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Dear Scott,<br /><br />I like the way you criticize the current state of development.

But that later date never comes, because after the product is done, the team moves on to the newer version with new stuff, and fixing bugs is dreadful work, new stuff is exciting. <br /><br />There's another thing about bugs which is also key in this issue: fixing them won't sell more licenses of vNext: people won't run to the store, yelling &quot;OMG! They fixed bug 33422!!!1 I can't believe it!&quot;. They'll run to the store because new, shiny things have been added, like a completely new UI with ergonomic characteristics of which no-one really knows whether it's actually a step forward. <br /><br />We all know software contains bugs, even though we did our best to fix them before RTM. But in the end, we have to admit that that label, 'RTM', is really just an arbitrary calendar event, not a landmark which says &quot;0 bugs!&quot;. This means that even though something went RTM, it doesn't mean it's bug free, it simply means: &quot;It's good enough that it won't kill kittens nor old ladies&quot;. <br /><br />A wise man, who passed away way too soon unfortunately, once said to me: &quot;Your motivation and ability to fix issues and bugs is part of the quality you want to provide&quot;, which means: even though at first glance your software might look stunning out of the box, if that essential part of the quality of the software is missing, i.e. when a bug pops up it gets fixed, pronto, your software isn't of the quality you think it is. <br /><br />If I look at today's software development landscape, I see a tremendous amount of people trying to write applications without the necessary skills and knowledge, in languages and platforms which have had a bad track-record for years, yet no-one seems to care, or at least too little. Last year I was in an open spaces session and some guy explained that they would place people who just started programming as 'trainee' at customers for 'free' and after a few months these trainees became 'junior' programmers and the client had to pay a fee per hour. I asked him what he thought of the term 'fraud', and he didn't understand what I meant. I tried to explain to him that if you think a person who has no training at all and you let him 'learn on the job' for a few months, is suddenly able to write any form of software, you're delusional.<br /><br />But with the lack of highly trained professional developers growing and growing each day, more and more people who can tell the difference between a keyboard and a mouse are hired to do 'dev work', as the client doesn't know better and is already happy someone is there to do the work. <br /><br />I fear it only gets worse in the coming years. Frankly, I'm fed up with the bullshit pseudo devs who seem to pop up more and more every day, who cry 'I'm just learning, don't be so rude!' when you tell them their work pretty much doesn't cut it, while at the same time they try to keep up the charade that they're highly skilled and experienced. <br /><br />Sadly this process of pseudo-devs which are seen as the true 'specialists', is in progress for some time now and will continue in the next decade I think. <br /><br />Let's hope they'll learn something about what 'quality' means with respect to software, that 'quality' is more than just the bits making up the software. But I'm not optimistic.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=6f2ed349e0ae96813a1159ce9a2cd1bb&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma">Frans Bouma</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="35a8b03f-a4a8-47e4-ada1-5b5b78ac756b"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 09:23:34 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I still think most people are missing the point.

They don't care if things don't work quite right, as long as Management approves. They don't care because they're paid the same no matter what. If they produce better code, they don't get more money - they just get questions about why they took longer. If Management says everything is fine, it must be. Ship it!<br /><br />2) Management knows absolutely nothing about development. Management was promoted from Sales, or was hired from some firm which made widgets for 30 years, or was the VP's Nephew's Friend's room-mate at Good Ol' Boy U. And they don't actually have to care to produce a mediocre, bug-riddled product - they have burndown charts they can point to, and time-tracking on work items. If the burndown line reaches the bottom, everything must be great, right? Ship it!<br /><br />3) 2 isn't willing to pay so much as one cent more to get a more motivated developer than in 1. Because they don't even know that the developer isn't motivated. They don't understand the code. They barely understand the app. They can't tell the difference between the worst code imaginable and the most sublime, bug-free code in existence. If it runs, it must be great, right? Ship it!<br /><br />4) New Developer Fresh Out Of School joins the business, and pretty rapidly learns that there's absolutely no point to doing a better job than &quot;just good enough,&quot; because when she produces amazing code, no one actually cares one iota more than when she produces mediocre code. If you know the code is bad, don't say anything because you'll be accused of complaining or &quot;not being a team player.&quot; Shut up and ship it!<br /><br />5) Testing - The tester can't actually read code any better than the manager, doesn't understand how to use any tools outside of the testing suite and the software under test, and isn't actually given any time to learn. They don't know how the customers use the software, so they can just test the most basic functionality. All the test systems are in VMWare or Lab Manager, and are wiped and reimaged before each test (Why would you ever bother to test software on a computer that has OTHER software installed on?). If it works fine when you follow the instructions *precisely*, don't bother testing any more (you're holding up progress!) - ship it!<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Those are the real obstacles. Commoditization of work. Disincentives for producing better work. Management that doesn't know anything about the business. Demotivational 'project management' that focuses on producing coloured charts instead of good software. Burning out new talent before they even have a chance to write good code. Failing to test beyond the most basic, vanilla scenarios.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e19dd5718d67d4810aaf7a2691418d1a&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">K</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="af943264-f306-4fd6-a38e-5bd682f78e9c"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 09:39:51 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Andrej Slivko -<br /><br />That's the dream scenario for many of us. Companies don't make PDBs available. They try to obfuscate code and symbols as much as is possible. They hide or encrypt *everything*, regardless of whether or not there's a reason. They don't produce any logs or, when they DO produce logs, they're in some proprietary format that only the company's internal tools can decipher.<br /><br />Microsoft makes this much easier in Windows with the public symbol server, most of the time, but when they fail to do so...<br /><br />I have an issue with an IE9 security update and some other software. The issue shows up when an IE DLL is called, but there are no PDBs available for the version currently shipping - no one told the IE team to put the symbols up.

First is what many have alluded to already - we want top-notch software, essentially for free. We have become accustomed to adding substantial function to our devices, as well as cloud-based/cross-platform/&quot;unlimited&quot; data and services at no charge. <br /><br />B. With the explosion of the mobile space, the pressure increases to innovate and push the bleeding edge out to consumers faster. Iteration cycles become shorter. There is increasing competitive pressure to get new features out the door. This is especially true in a world where all of the players and platforms intersect in the web space. To me, this has an impact on the QA cycle and upon vendors ability to design for both forward and future compatibility. <br /><br />C. &quot;Standards&quot; have become a moving target. <br /><br />D. There are more, but it is early, and I have not yet finished my first cup of coffee. <br /><br />To me, this all falls into the category I like to call the &quot;Apollo&quot; or &quot;NASA&quot; syndrome - IN 1969, the US put a man on the moon. Multiple times. Following this, they developed a re-usable space shuttle program, which operated successfully (with some caveats) for thirty + years.  The complexity of these ventures (or most other space-program undertakings) is nearly unrivaled in the history of human technology. Yet, the biggest headlines pop up when things go WRONG. <br /><br />Given the complexity inherent in our modern computing and software systems, what is amazing to me is not that there are bugs and compatibility issues, it is that there are not MORE of them. <br /><br />Great post Mr. Hanselman, and spot-on. Just wanted to throw  a different perspective out there. </div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c5583010c58623c1540cd1ed5db931e5&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://Typecastexception.com">John Atten</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="c216d25b-61e9-48c4-859d-a6fceb4e3020"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 11:58:52 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Remember.

I'm sure if you look around you'll find a lot of people doing a lot of things to fix software quality and improve user experience in software applications.  <br /><br />But, consider what's really broken in the world:  food supply, resource depletion, pollution, poverty, crime, violence, war...

Clearly the priority and focus for the software you're using is not on quality and experience.  It seems the software industry has optimized to get-product-out and iterate asap.  Ship!<br /><br />But then, when I consider the larger question of &quot;what's broken?&quot; where I look at the real issues in the world, I come to the same answer: the priority and focus of society is not tilted strongly enough towards fixing those types of big-world problems.

I personally think there are many variables which lead to lower quality products from timeline and budget contraints to poor process management or just poor software project management in general. Think about architecture for a few minutes. In our daily lives how much time do we spend thinking about how to build the software versus just building it? I know most of my peers have said things like &quot;why do I need a class diagram?&quot; or &quot;Why waste time making these plans to code when I can just code&quot;. I am fortunate where I get to make the architecture decisions, but, that doesn't mean I always have the time to do so and many companies won't hire people to focus on just architecture which is where the quality issues start. A lot of the quality issues happen before even a single line of code is written through requirement analysis and figuring out exactly what the customer actually needs. The stats say 70% of the cost of software is in figuring out the problem so why spend so much time coding before we plan right?<br /><br />Iphone 5 is a good example. Do we really NEED a phone that is thinner and lighter with a slightly better camera? Not really... but the public wants that so apple is giving the public what they want. It does lead to poor quality though and less innovation in the software community. Without having a driver toward people who are really innovative companies will continue to ignore the problem and just keep developing the same thing over and over in a shinier package.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=6a41d518de5831e70e56d0d022d060c4&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Aaron</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="1fd554d7-9f16-4ba0-b2a8-da06d2d1e07c"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 13:24:07 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I think it comes down to serveral reasons:<br /><br />1.

I have a friend that has a birthday sometime in June.  When June comes around, I'll look at the Calendar, and I'll see his birthday listed on June 12th, 13th, and 14th.  Apparently he was born on 3 different but consecutive days.  Somehow his birthday has spread like a virus.  And I have no clue which day it *really* is, because I don't remember - that's why I put it on my calendar.

When my software has problems it's sometimes really hard to know where to even start when there's at least (quick count) 5 layers between my code and the signals on the wire (my code, toolkit api, jitter/language, vm, os, tcp/ip stack or disk or other resource).  More than likely its my problem, of course.  <br /><br />But when things go wrong and I suspect it's not my problem I don't have many choices except to shift the stack a bit and find another way to do it.  There's no realistic way given the constraints of time and money to do anything else.  OSS doesn't help much either.

All too close to home!<br /><br />It's interesting how many comments have some element of &quot;blame the victim&quot; (e.g., you're using too many products, you'd be better off buying Chevrolet gasoline to go with that fancy Bel Air).<br /><br />It's also interesting how many comments here focus on some specific problem (e.g., setting up an alternate account with one-way frobozzes will resynthesize the index deletions), while missing the big picture that these are <b>symptoms</b>. It's <b>all</b> bad.<br /><br />As a profession, we <b>can</b> do better. We know how to do better. We've been taught how to do better since the 1970s, when modularity and data hiding really came into their own. But, alas, we're in a hurry, and doing better requires hard work: <b>thinking</b>. The problem is not that it's hard to enumerate a zillion test cases--that wouldn't be as much of an issue if we focused on getting things right in the first place, on designing for isolation and independence. Heck, maybe focus on designing at all, rather than on getting the latest greatest tiny update out as fast as possible.<br /><br />But it's been clearly demonstrated that what the market wants is crap in a hurry, and that's what it gets. The problem is exacerbated by the purveyors' need to deliver constant &quot;improvements&quot; to existing functional products in order to garner more revenue, which in turn requires grossly incompatible changes with great frequency just to wean satisfied users away from working solutions and force them to adopt more expensive new (but hardly improved) technologies. <br /><br />For more on this, read anything by Don Norman, or <i>Why Software Sucks...and What You Can Do About It</i> by David Platt.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7776907d9b0bb5fd2e58dc1454c0ebe0&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Olin Sibert</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="acd61324-15fc-49c1-8ebb-cc5727976c42"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 14:19:27 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Scott, this is a first world problem.

I wonder if those people felt like nobody cares back then too.

The ability to create software, and indeed to complain about its quality online is the highest form of individual empowerment and communication capability we've ever seen.

Really messes with Dev Express.<br />3. asp.net sites claiming compile errors because of temp directory crud not getting updated by VS.net when a change is made to a project that the website depends up on. Requires close of Vs.net and kill of temp folder.<br />4. If you have a ton of errors in the same file (common if you're refactoring by hand) and you start at the top of errors list and ever delete a line of code, all others in the errors list will be off by one line. It doesn't automatically update.<br />5. Vs.net 2012 routinely fails with intellisense. Only solution is to close the file and reopen it. Minor but annoying and new in VS.net 2012.<br />6. Package Manager Console in Vs.net 2012 project drop down is always blank so you can't pick a project to do things like EF Update-Database etc. Have to hack the manual commands. Yuk.<br />7. Windows 8 RTM, if you do a lot of copying and pasting (over and over again) of files, especially with drag and drop, Windows Explorer crashes without error. Doesn't kill the start menu interestingly.<br />8. Windows 8 doesn't let me have multiple metro apps up on multiple screens. Yuk. This one thing would have made the OS OK to use.<br />9. Windows 8 loss of start menu. Should have been replaced with a Windows Phone 7 style small version vertically scrolling of the main start screen. Pita.<br />10. Windows 8 native apps have screwy mouse support that didn't adapt and it's a shame. It should have been changed to work like a tablet and scroll by grabbing (click and hold) and highlighting and drag and drop should have been changed to click and hold longer like WP7. Then panorama and everything else would have worked great just like touch and people using a mouse wouldn't have hated it. (also works on a touch pad too)<br />11. Chrome routinely freaks out loading a google result that you click on and shows the previous page loaded instead of the new one.<br />12. Ever since google started redirecting through themselves on links instead of going directly to the link clicking through results is slow as hell. Bing is better but not great.<br />13. Microsoft please release a complete bluetooth stack that works with all bluetooth dongles and not just your own and has all profiles for all devices. The ones from the manufacturers SUCK.<br />14. Seriously you can't boot Windows Media Center on start up in Windows 8? Seriously?<br />15. Seriously you're not replacing Windows Media Center with a Windows 8 native set of apps? (see below)<br /><br /><br />My #1 biggest peeve:<br /><br />Microsoft: Release a box that takes a cable card and has a power, Coax, USB 3 and CAT6 plug on the back. Work with the cable companies to automate cable card pairing and activation. Make it run Windows Embedded and automatically detect new hard drives plugged into the USB port and automatically add it to the drive pool for recording. Make it do nothing but handle the schedule,and record shows. Make it seriously cheap. Then provide an open interface that anyone can use to communicate with it and stream video, but create a consistent interface on Xbox 360 and Windows 8 in metro style. - Take over the TV world by doing this before Apples does it. Don't try and create your own cable company, waste of time for now. But cable card gives you the solution and a box that just works that xbox 360 can use and control with guide etc. or Windows 8 same way and any device can play anything and the box can record/live stream 6 shows at once (max cable card supports) and you're done. Ultimately work out deals with Dish and DirecTV to plugin as well with an adapter.  I know the WMC group is disbanded but this is how you own it. Why are you not doing this? It's the logical next step for WMC and will hit a HUGE market fast especially if you have iOS, Android and WP clients and it can work in and out of the home. Head shake as to why this isn't happening yesterday? You should have released this 2 years ago or more when you brought out the Xbox dashboard with Metro Design language. DO NOT PUT THE RECORDING IN THE XBOX. Let multiple xboxs work as set top boxes. Work with the TV manufacturers to licence access to the boxes. Let other companies connect and create their own interfaces. Google wouldn't be able to compete, neither would apple if you do this right and it would assure Xbox 720 would own the console market too because Sony would be behind the 8 ball and if you patent it properly you could block everyone out.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=064bc5f5c10efcafceedce2f0868a3ec&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawnLrMKYB0vzyuczr-cAstsjXPy-yoiJQe0"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />James Hancock</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="c6037f85-5c96-4270-99d3-27cfbed2d7c4"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 14:27:24 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I believe its simply because we, from the average to the seasoned professional, have historically taken software for granted which is partly because of the dynamic pace at which technology evolves that there is so less time to perfect it and partly because we don't care 7/10 times is great</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=10182d69606c4ebda88e1bbc848222f1&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Abhilash</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="fd26f18c-5750-4018-a831-c9f2804a0273"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 14:28:57 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Is it a people problem? - Yes<br /><br />Are folks just not passionate about their software enough to fix it? - No<br />I am a passionate developer, but I am not a genius.<br />I seek opportunities to learn from passionate geniuses, but my unfortunate experiences are that geniuses don’t get into details, they cost your time and money and create some issues, and then they tell you that your system sucks and leave<br /><br /></div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b9d6059c5e98b2d07f7641be1ef6795b&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">day day up</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="9ee75bc2-ec43-4250-8667-97f0c76ace4e"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 14:32:15 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Bugs are to the benefit of companies like Microsoft and Apple.

A lot of sad people.<br /><br />On the other hand, if instead the corporation just increases the version number and start selling the buggy software, there's no expense, there's sales income, therefore benefit, therefore good quarterly results, increasing share price, happy share holders, good &quot;economic statistics&quot;, good GDP, optimism, enterprises hiring, people get hired.  Everybody's happy.<br /><br />On the other hand, software that's not developed in a commercial environment, eg. GNU emacs, is delivered when its completed.  There's no dead-line time limit for when a new version is release: the next version of GNU emacs is released when it's ready.  The result is that while emacs is the application that I use the most (I always have it running), it's even more stable than the underlying linux system (which has to be rebooted when upgrading new drivers).  On the above mentionned system, I have emacs instances that are running since more than one year.<br /><br /><br />There's also another consideration.  Operating System research has been practically stopped since the late eighties.  The fact that commercial corporations have standardized on IBM PC and then Microsoft Windows killed all the effervecent competition there was between various computer architectures and diverse operating systems, both from the commercial offer, and the academic research.  See for example http://herpolhode.com/rob/utah2000.pdf<br /><br />There are a few searchers who try to develop new OS concepts.  For example Jonathan S. Shapiro was working on capability-based OS (eros-os and then coyotos), but he was stopped in his tracks, by being hired by Microsoft.  Again, one has to find food, clothing and shelter for oneself and family, and in the current system, that means the commercial corporate world.<br /><br />http://venusproject.org <br />www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/<br /><br />There is a very strong spirit of herd in humanity, so it's also hard to expect much.  Yes, there may be bad systems, but as long as 85% of the people are using them, they keep using them.  Sometimes for the good &quot;network effects&quot;, sometimes for the economic mass effect (but nowadays we'd have the means to produce more personnalised products, so there's no strong reason to have billion of identical phones on the market), but more often just because the rest of the herd is doing the same.<br /><br /></div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9e2504e0b74e5384af09ce8a660afac4&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Pascal Bourguignon</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="5b48771f-b632-4387-81c6-8c55841793ef"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 14:36:26 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I think that the main problem is a lack of accountability. When a product and/or service has a clear owner, it tends to be better because when people have feedback, it's clear who to give it to.

Who owns that experience? I have an issue with the Videos app in Windows 8.

This expectation causes the quality bar to be set really low. I have always tried to mitigate this by insisting that our in-house development efforts only be of the highest quality, but when your end users are also your quality assurance testers you run into problems. Bottom line is that- and I'm speaking <i>really</i> generally- apathetic users don't inspire the best efforts. And sometimes- Agile be damned- there is a deadline that must be met due to business or regulatory conditions.

I believe it is about accountability, which wraps in all of those arguments. <br /><br />Software doesn't *need* to work, and we agree to that every time we click the &quot;I agree to these terms&quot; box. There is no cost to turning out a failure-prone product so long as it is (to a sufficiently large audience) in some way more desirable than the alternatives, or it at least sells enough to pay back the development costs. <br /><br />If Apple had to pay for your time spent fixing your iCloud Photo stream, Microsoft had to pay for the cycles wasted while the indexing service churned away at nothing, or Google had to reimburse you for lost business when Chrome made you bust a deadline because it screwed up Visual Studio... Those companies would either get out of the business or tighten up their code and make sure it played well with everything they could possibly test. QA budgets would skyrocket, and so would the cost of software.<br /><br />I don't see any way to impose accountability, though, and I'm pretty sure that if we did, innovation would come to a crashing halt and then restart at only a glacial pace. <br /><br />So, aside from perhaps being an interesting observation, I suppose none of that is very useful.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=473c31b6b1cc5e8d39df8f5654db5115&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Eric Kervina</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="f6a582ef-ec60-4f3e-8314-13043db59a7a"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 15:03:43 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Maybe, it's as the Nokia Lumia ad says, &quot;We are all part of the beta test&quot;.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">fallenprogrammr</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="48c01736-1fe7-4218-871f-075f8ede076e"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 15:06:58 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Scott,<br />first of, throw your IGarbage products where they supposed to be and get a window phone 8. =P<br />I totally agree with your post, but we can't forget the factor that drives our lives in software development and engineering &quot;Meet the dead line at any cost no matter what&quot; of find yourself replaced by the next dude that wants to try.<br />nobody cares about QA as much as they should, scopes are constantly changed and dead lines as constantly static. </div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=751a896ebb3a2c3fbc4125ec8683f8dd&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Leandro</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="29033780-35b8-4b5d-89c0-2576351864c6"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 15:19:32 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I've been reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ruark">Robert Ruark's work</a> recently.<br /><br />One of the last things he had published was an essay called &quot;Nothing Works and Nobody Cares&quot;.

Stories like this drive me more to push quality upstream and hold the line politically when errors are bad.<br /><br />But yeah, when timelines are shorter (remember when huge software products took 5 years or more to get right?), quality requirements are lower (how many users will really do THAT?), and upper management now has less of a real connection to the software (since somehow now everyone wants to run a business rather than solve simple life problems).<br /><br />That said, these instances all make me want to face-palm, then go into work and spend a little extra time selfhosting and working on integration testing. Because the last bit that I didn't read above (sorry, too many comments) is I believe that when we are all building more complex software, test teams (if you HAVE a test team; *cough* Facebook) spend more and more time focused on the complexity of their features and less on the experience of using the product. <br /><br />If software engineers on the whole recognized the priority of software quality, then maybe the role of test engineer would be more common. Today, its just not.<br /><br />It WILL get worse before it gets better though. Most engineers just don't get it. They use all the workarounds you mention as a part of daily life, then go back to work and keep ignoring the pain. Not until regular users just literally can't use the product anymore and don't buy it will this pattern change.<br /><br />I feel your pain.

Many companies don't want to do real budgets around software engineering.  Project costs should be budgeted as an investment into the product.  Instead, many companies just scrounge up the bare minimum they can find and see what can be done with it.<br /><br />Given the Time-Money-Quality triangle, quality is the first to go.  High quality software requires money and time.  You need to hire project managers, testers, designers, tech-writers, etc.  Companies that just lean on their developers to get as much done as they can are clearly sacrificing quality in favor of reducing head-count, salaries, and time to market.  I think the small companies and large companies alike are guilty of this.<br /><br />That said - why is it that hardware engineering doesn't seem to have this issue?  That shiny new iPhone took plenty of competent engineers, but also lots of overhead from project managers, designers, quality control specialists, and much more.  Can you imagine if Jobs had just found another Woz and asked him to build an iPhone?<br /><br />One wonders if the rise of 3D printing, self-fabrication, hobby electronics, etc. will end up corrupting the hardware industry.  When hardware engineers stop designing stuff and start just throwing things together because their boss asked them to - they will be exactly where we are today with software.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=794cec60f3e80ceb7e6f7a2647d0ad2e&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawlF9LNtzKgLz-e6W0hV5Dvy7hMHH2A9Klg"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />Matt Johnson</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="5e38d5d3-428e-4fb6-9c65-7974db72db22"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 15:38:50 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">What isn't broken?

There's also the number of domains you need to address (from telephony to car driving, from contacts to enterprise assets).<br /><br />But there's something else. A root cause of many bugs is the fallacy that the code behaves like the concepts we have in our head. You see a &quot;person&quot; in the code and you assume that it somehow behaves like a real person, when maybe it's just a first/last name pair that is not good enough to uniquely identify a person. And you end up with contact sync bugs or instant messages going to the wrong window.<br /><br /><a href="http://xlr.sourceforge.net/Concept%20Programming%20Presentation.pdf">Concept programming</a> challenges this core tenet, by putting the focus on the conversion from concept to code, which is always lossy. It gives us a few metrics to identify what might go wrong. With the help of concept programming tool chest, you will quickly realize just how broken something as simple as your &quot;max&quot; function is.

Developers are discouraged from considering their work art or craftsmanship. Emotional detachment is critical, I agree, but nearly every development methodology siphons passion out of coding in an extremely effective manner. And when developers stop fighting for code elegance,  quality spirals quickly. I've never seen high quality code produced when the developers weren't willing to fight management tooth and nail over feature bloat and quirk maintenance.  Everything is a tradeoff, but each non-critical checkbox that is introduced generally doubles the number of logic state permutations, and halves the ability to perform complete Q &amp; A.<br /><br />2. Leaky abstractions are considered 'acceptable' by management. Software capabilities are limited by how tall we can stack the layers. Perfect layers can be stacked infinitely, but imperfections trickle up exponentially. Software innovation has slowed to a trickle, in a nearly logarithmic fashion, and it's the fault of layer quality just as much as the patent wars.<br /><br />3. Money is one of the least effective ways to encourage creativity and craftsmanship (see &quot;Effective Programming: More than writing code&quot; by Jeff Atwood, great read).<br /><br />To me, the only strategy for solving the layer and quality problem on a large scale would involve nearly removing the monetary reward and management interference factor. And to be truthful, this strategy wouldn't work on a small scale, either. Only large companies with very diverse software needs would reap significant direct benefit over a traditional management approach. Finding developers who craft excellent libraries and beautiful layers is possible, but dictating what they want to work in is not - you can inspire, herd, and motivate interest/passion, but you cannot dictate it. However, on  a large enough scale, (such as at Microsoft, Apple, HP, IBM, etc), it's unlikely any creation of very high quality won't find its own utility somewhere. <br /><br />1. Locate a large number of software craftsmen and craftswomen; people driven by the desire for perfection, who create elegant and artful solutions to complex problems, and have a good bit of altruism.  How do you locate these people, you ask? By browsing GitHub, or looking within your own ranks for dissatisfied, despairing, yet accomplished perfectionists.<br /><br />2. Calculate the cost of living for each person (and their family), and pay them no less and not significantly more. Eliminate the monetary reward factor. Re-evaluate periodically to adjust for family changes, medical problems, etc. Eliminating monetary stress is just as important. I know this is impossible to do perfectly, but it shouldn't be very difficult to improve on the existing situation. Providing accounting and budgeting services to the developers is an easy way to monitor and manage things. You don't want to make money a carrot *or* a stick; helping them get by with less money is not necessarily a disservice.<br /><br />3. Promise that any patents derived from their code will never be used for offensive purposes, and will never be sold. License every line of code they create under an OSI-approved license, have an accessible staff of layers in case ambiguities arise.<br /><br />3. Decouple management as much as possible, with a ratio of 1/8 to 1/20 'handlers' per agents. And use your best managers, people that are rockstar coders and were born with enough people skills to charm a gargoyle. These people are already good at self-management, or they wouldn't be creating high-quality work on their own. But looking 3-10 years ahead, determining what layers will be needed, and  inspiring them to work on *those* projects is not a task you should assign to any but your best.<br /><br />4. Evaluate projects every two weeks, to help keep them on track, or suggest a deviation if they need a break. Handlers serve more as counselors than managers.<br />5. Evaluate individual suitability  for the program every 18 months, or sooner if requested by the individual. Provide an easy path into and out of the program; this will increase employee retention rates and allow developers with good foresight to save the company's collective behind occasionally, and also permit agents with flagging interest to return to the 'standard business environment' without repercussion. <br />6. Encourage collaboration between agents, but do not require it. Require good code readability, good documentation, and well-focused unit tests, such that an project can be picked up by another developer within 3 weeks. Allow agents to act as coordinators if their projects achieve sufficient popularity and the intrest of other top-tier devs.<br /><br />This is not a small-scale or short-term strategy, nor one that can be employed on people that aren't already in the top-tier. However, I suspect it will attract a *lot* of top-tier talent that would otherwise be inaccessible to a large enterprise. And I think it would eliminate the talent loss that seems to be occurring everywhere. <br /><br />Many of the best developers are driven by desire for immortality - they want to write code so elegant, so reusable that it never dies; layers so perfect they are never replaced. Find a way to channel that desire, make that code a possibility, and you can solve a lot of really hard problems with a very small amount of cash and a few high-quality  handlers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e246b32ac5e470afb71f8221a9759da2&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawlMWHQUr0jzqNYd0Q6kx-xWw5xgZ7C19pk"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />Nathanael Jones</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="aba31959-3598-4b49-94be-14233c4d09c1"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 16:38:44 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I would suggest moving to Google's ecosystem.

There is often low or negative value placed on making your stuff work well with the competitor's stuff. It is seen as a chore, or a tax, or un-strategic. Even when the customer benefits are recognized, it can be very challenging to coordinate technically with a competitor. Cross platform issues receive limited development resources, testing, and support. When problems arise it's easy to pass the blame. So as an end-user you see frustrating bugs that no one takes ownership for and never get fixed.<br /><br />For example: Apple bootcamp + Windows 7 x64 + Lion: In June '12 I upgraded my MBP to OSX Lion and it silently wrote a new recovery partition over the first several hundred MBs of my Windows partition. I won't soon forget sitting down with an Apple filesystem engineer at WWDC and hexdumping the top of my Windows partition to see it no longer started with the NTFS signature! I later found that this catastrophic data loss bug had been reported many times in Apple Support forums for almost a year before Apple's latest OSX installer wiped out my filesystem. But in that interval Apple apparently did not bother to fix it, did not even deign to add a bootcamp check or warning to their installer. This was not an esoteric scenario, nor did Apple lack resources to catch it in testing or fix it promptly after the first reports. Rather, their actions (inaction) reflects their priorities here.<br /><br />In such cases, Carl's idea for a central public wall of shame has merit.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=08967650872c222a1f23ed33b7468e42&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawneKJx_F5Tmr5to6Yknd9zP6JUyO71Dm-8"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />Jan Gray</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="89dd1bb3-f633-40c3-a0ca-68afd3b14f91"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 17:28:28 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I'll begin by agreeing that the failure rate of computer hardware/software is incredible for a product with its price point. <br /><br />For example, you can buy a new computer that will routinely f-up, or for the same $2K, by an old but highly functional used car. <br /><br />Not only is there no doubt which one will have fewer problems, the problems the used car has will not be catastrophic. They'll just cost money. <br /><br />On the other hand, a misbehaving computer can trash your disk, overload your network, become a zombie in a botnet, overload peripherals, etc...<br /><br />As to what the problem is, I'm reminded of a saying I've heard many times in the software development process:<br /><blockquote>There are four key factors in software development:<br />1) Budget/Resources<br />2) Features<br />3) Deadline<br />4) Quality<br /><br /><br />It is an inevitable fact of nature that management can only choose three of the four factors.</blockquote><br />Nearly every software product I've been involved with has had management choosing the first three factors because budget, features, and deadline are critical to a business's success <u><strong>and</strong></u> easily measured. Software quality is hard to measure. <br /><br />Tthe more management focuses on budget, features, and deadlines, the less time there is for testing. This reduces the number of known bugs and, ironically, gives the <u><strong>appearance</strong></u> of better quality.<br /><br />Focus on the first three also forces engineering to skimp on testing, ship products with serious, well-known bugs, delay rewriting and refactoring of code to make it more stable, etc...<br /><br />As a comparison, my first &quot;real-world&quot; software position was a summer internship for Grumman working on revamping the F-14. More than half of the development time, before a single line of code was written, involved designing requirements, specifying tests to meet those requirements, and writing those tests. The even put an actual cockpit of an F-14, along with a giant computer system to simulate flight, into the testing lab. <br /><br />Suggesting this level of testing to a software manufacturer would surely evoke laughter. In the computing business, extensive testing seems to be replaced by a mad-rush to the finish -- sometimes even requiring the movement of QA to development to meet deadlines. <br /><br />While having an exclusive contract and being paid cost+ leads to waste and even criminal activities, it does have its advantages..</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=edb05224f5487da1885e83104a00d8b5&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.neilsmithline.com">Neil Smithline</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="84963800-51e2-4a9a-8823-1373d3895d67"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 17:43:19 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I think that we, as software engineers, took a wrong turn somewhere about 2004.  We had grown up suffering from brittle, procedural spaghetti code.  We knew that it wouldn't scale and it wasn't maintainable.  And we were sick of looking at the same old winforms applications. We were intrigued by smart phones and tablets (yes, there were Windows based tablets then).  We knew that thick client applications wouldn't scale, and that object oriented design was a better way to handle complexity than procedural programming.  So we invented n-tier, thin client computing and we founded it on OOD/OOP principles.<br /><br />It had some issues early on.  We wanted rich client-side interactions that a pure thin-client browser could not deliver.  We wanted asynchronous requests with lazy responses that http simply could not deliver at the time.  But I think when the going got tough, we abandoned our principles in favor of features and quick solutions.<br /><br />So today we have thick clients again, albeit implemented in the browser using a scripting language that barely supports OOD/OOP (yes, I mean JavaScript).  Spaghetti code is back with a vengeance.  Only now it takes the form of ajax calls to arbitrary service interfaces over unreliable networks.  We talk about domain driven design and the SOLID principles, but in reality about 80% of the code we write is just crap.  It can't recover from a failure, it breaks if the implementation behind its interfaces change even slightly.  If you don't believe me, open up any MVC sample and try to find any evidence of software resiliency, true separation of concerns, portability, or consideration for reuse.<br /><br />I think we need to start thinking about this whole n-tier problem again from the ground up, because what we have now is not going to work for complex, enterprise class applications over time.  Most of all, I think we need a true object compiler for the browser and design, coding, and testing paradigms that cross the server to client boundary seamlessly, so that we can enforce software design quality from end to end.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=470e84913cff9f86486caf03d06d2b45&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawl94ogv2vBadtY8oQyBqYsWrR1LGnzlf-w"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />Walt Smith</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="42da65a4-0bb2-42d9-b2f2-0bf4a64b7be0"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 17:44:27 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Software will never be perfect, but you're still right in assuming it could be better than it is.<br /><br />There are many different areas to look at for improving future work.  It's easy to get stuck on the first one, which is the developers themselves.  Sure, it's obvious if they wrote perfect code, everything would be perfect, but that's an unreasonable view to assume the fix is you just need better developers, because that's an even more complex problem than saying you just need better software.  It needlessly simplifies everything and ignores root causes while providing no real solution.<br /><br />What we need to ask, is how could we encourage a better average competency among developers, and how can we remove more of the impediments that require developers to not just be good but superhuman.<br /><br />Training is always an idea, more might help, but there's already enough to show it can't in single handedly solve much.<br /><br />Being more selective is a good question.  Do we really need as many developers as we have?  Or would be better off removing or redistributing such that good developers aren't cleaning up messes of green or nearly incompetent ones?<br /><br />Oh sure, that might help, but who would do this selection?  Managers would be the obvious answer, but we seem to have an epidemic failure among software management of the ability to evaluate performance of developers.<br /><br />The few really good facts we have on what allows developers to perform at their best are ignored not just occasionally, but almost entirely.  Arbitrary deadlines are the norm, despite evidence that they always produce lower quality results, and often take longer too.<br /><br />Fiat design, handed down from management, is the norm.  This despite the obvious knowledge that few people will be both expert in design and in managing people, thus leading to a predictable failure in one or both of these inappropriately married roles.<br /><br />And last but not least, the mixed messages provided to developers on the importance of quality in all aspects.  You're very unlikely to have a quality product if you don't care about the quality of your code, about the completeness of your tests, the health and well being of your developers, or your communication practices.  Yet over and over messages such as schedule at all costs are transmitted.  Even when a message such as quality is simultaneously stated, the damage is done.  At best, after some confusing the schedule message is ignored.  At worst a team vacilates between one side and the other, constantly screwing up their code, only to then lament at their inability to fix it (and spend a lot of time talking about what's wrong and how they can't fix it, while never actually fixing anything).<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=befdbe1213392044e071b6955ef54069&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawmeAvbi1jz3PqWT3Muga55bCR9dIZmf1rw"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />Ryan Baker</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="073b8afc-7696-4467-a689-79999111f697"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 17:45:27 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Album art and genius results take up a lot of 'Other' space on your iPhone.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=a20e17a9518a5db04659c0b21b80d64d&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawl9gKzjUxUz8fD5JRH2TnVWZcbqAMopCkE"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />Scott Holodak</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="767b097b-9ee6-43bf-b51a-781d002b70ac"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 17:46:15 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I feel your pain Scott, but I'm more inclined to blame it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_Law">Sturgeon's law</a>.

I have extreme confidence in my tools. I've learned to tune my machine to prevent failure. When something does go wrong, I can fix it without taking it back to the manufacturer. Often, I find a problem and learn how to fix it, thus preventing the problem from happening again in the future.<br /><br />Software is not like this. The user usually cannot fix problems in the software (even in Open Source software). Tools change so frequently that new skills must constantly be acquired and then lost to make room for different ones. I'm in online education so I profit from this, but it still frustrates me.<br /><br />The most frustrating thing to me is perfectly good features that are removed from software.

I have not met a person who has used it on the desktop who liked it.  How are invisible spaces on the desktop that you have to hover over good for usability?  Why do I have to hover over the lower left hand part of the screen (and then wait) to see a start tile... why can't they just put the button there.  Why do I have to hover of the invisible part of the lower right hand screen to get the charms menu to come up (if my main monitor is on the left, I frequently slide off of it onto the second monitor).  This maybe good for a tablet (I love my WP7 phone) but it's horrible on the desktop.  Why does alt tab only show the desktop and not all my open apps (if this isn't proof that the desktop is a second class citizen I don't know what is).  At a minimum, it should be customizable to metro/vs. desktop view (and I'm not buying usability arguments from MS because I commonly have to go 2 or 3 clicks deeper and out of context to get to common tasks I need).  <br /><br />In summary, Windows failed on the tablet for 10 years because they tried to cram a desktop OS onto a tablet and it was hard to use.  They didn't learn their lesson.  Now, they're trying to cram a tablet interface onto the desktop.  Tablets are all the rage, but seriously, you lose your desktop market and you will be hurting.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ea73632204fe29e1e7a50e059d808ac9&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawlffi0X6FS1f6DwC093KkgjbqXqy33zjdE"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />Chris Poland</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="443e7749-2cbf-43c5-b221-08c5eeb02cdd"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 19:15:28 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">And your post showed up twice in Google Reader.  &lt;sigh&gt;</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=229138f2e2b83c8d7068964405d9ba51&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawlKh7e_tirXKOY7DhOCbjnER44c1KUwf_k"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />Marvin Bobo</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="b9e8896d-e306-4a39-9437-5a769b08bcb1"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 19:23:31 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">My common beefs:<br /><br /> - The ASP.NET Development Server with Visual Studio 2010 throws &quot;Out of Memory Exceptions&quot; after 10 to 15 minutes of use on any project (don't have this problem with 2008).<br /> - Outlook stops refreshing mail, requires you to manually enter your password which also doesn't work.

Being a developer is <em>hard</em>. It requires a cognition for which evolution has ill equipped us.<br /><br />The problem will only get worse. Gone are the days when one could master C and be a productive contributor for the foreseeable future. The software landscape is now a roiling morass of frameworks and protocols and half-interoperable languages, all with unpredictable life cycles. No one can know enough, and Jacks of All Trades are still Masters of None.<br /><br />In the same way that casual development results in log files that cannot be automatically processed, so too casual meta-development results in frameworks, protocols, and languages that cannot be automatically analyzed in conjunction, much less in isolation. In a slower world, analysis tools would be scraping the cruft and automating the menial, the weights that make even the smallest software task feel like heavy lifting. And they would be training us in the process to boot.<br /><br />But they can't much now and they won't much later. Because the problem of software quality is not a matter of complexity, or attention to detail, or the fact that we can't even model heterogeneous systems—beyond their source—to say nothing of analyzing them for &quot;obvious&quot; inconsistencies and vulnerabilities. (In the time it takes to write a useful analysis, the shifting landscape has marked its obsolescence.)<br /><br />No, the problem is a matter of difficult and unsexy tasks, and what we'd rather be doing. And until that changes, we are left with the status quo: that working software is amazing (and nobody is happy).</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=fd01671137fb58d2673fcf03698134b5&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Nathan D.

There are enough talented developers out there willing to do the right thing that we could have all the products we want, and of much higher quality than we get today, but the obstacle is destructive management practices.<br /><br />That includes focusing too much on schedules and staffing projects with masses of incompetency and allowing no time and providing no motivation to develop competency.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=befdbe1213392044e071b6955ef54069&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawmeAvbi1jz3PqWT3Muga55bCR9dIZmf1rw"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />Ryan Baker</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="54823c12-51d1-4f91-b583-0570ef3444d0"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 20:23:38 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Hi, I fully understand feeling from Scott. However, software (including Operating systems) have become more complex compared to 30 years ago. Sometimes it is too costly to exercise every test case and QA would include critical, but then cherry-pick the other cases. I've seen it in our own internal development/qa. <br />Here is an example: I currently have a problem with my VS 2010 not being able to run a specific asp.net app with the VS dev web server (built-in webserver)--it is just stuck at waiting from response from localhost-- when IE opens. You look at this example and ask well; what are the dependencies? framework versions, vs configuration, service packs (os and vs), environment, MS hot fixes (Kb) on the machine, vs plugins, etc.  You check on the web and see some folks having a similar issue--but may not be quite exact, and tried their remedies and did not work. Some folks questions go unanswered and they end up rebuilding a machine. BTW, in my case it is not a problem with the app, because other devs can open the same solution on their machine and it runs fine.  This is just one issue, but as you dig deeper, it becomes a wormhole ready to suck you in totally. </div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Hansel</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="5ca6d2a1-b296-44db-b62b-12e884148fbd"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 20:26:51 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Did you say you work for Microsoft?.

Developers rely on them to point out their mistakes. So the blame squarely lies on the QA teams. <br /><br />I heard that Steve Jobs was involved with every aspect of the iPhone. It sounds to me like he was the QA person for iPhone. If we do not like to hear that Steve Jobs was doing QA for iPhone, then we have a problem. QA needs more respect.<br /><br />I also have a general point to make - we have to stop giving too much respect/importance to the 'process' i.e. software engineering, and start giving more respect/importance to 'people' i.e. developers, QA teams etc. You need great 'people' to build great software. A great 'process' can only be an add-on.<br /><br />I also sometimes find it amusing that everyone has accepted the fact that the foremost quality that code should have is that it needs to be 'maintainable' i.e. it needs to be written in such a way that, a new developer can look at the code and understand what is going on. That is HR-attrition-economics stuff. Some emphasis should be given to 'maintainability', but we seem to have gone overboard with it. We have to note that, 'maintainability' has nothing to do with 'usability', 'performance', 'design', of an application. <br /><br /></div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3eda6fcd3204ef285fa52176c28c4d3e&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://theacadian.myopenid.com/"><img class="commentOpenId" src="images/openid-icon-small.gif" border="0" />theacadian.myopenid.com</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="15bc5029-1074-4112-be0c-b1da753be869"></a>Monday, 17 September 2012 20:40:37 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I agree with Brad C.'s comments.

New hardware is shipped with bugs and becomes outdated before I could read reviews about it.<br /><br />Basically every piece of software you use is a prototype, a pilot project, it's never going to get finished, because there is no time to make it good.

When it takes specialised knowledge or tools to even detect the problem most of the time, it's hard to convince laypeople that it's worth spending money detecting and correcting the problem.<br /><br />With software it's sometimes the size of the thing to be tested, but as often it's just hard to see the problem at all. &quot;uses extra disk space&quot;... so what?<br /><br />Also, the thing with small software teams is that generally that means the source code is small enough to be understood by one person. So naturally it's easier to spot and fix systematic errors. But I don't think those teams are any more likely than a big team to address larger problems like &quot;sometimes the JRE stops releasing memory, then after a while the device crashes&quot;. I don't expect the programmer from some random java app to fix that issue, OSS or not. Even though it only starts when I'm running their app.<br /><br />Personally what I face quite often is a sprawling codebase that's not understood by anyone who still works in the company. It's big and fragile, and different people have learned about different parts, so any change is fraught. It's like the architecture tour I did recently where the engineering manager said &quot;see that giant nest of pipework?

To a certain extent the fact that so many test artifacts are produced and so much goes into software QA and buggy software is STILL released by enterprises -- bugs that gnaw away at usability until the product effectively rots -- suggests that the way we write software and what we write it on has become a spaghettified mess.<br /><br />I find the following article cathartic reading now and then, for putting a finger on what has gone wrong with the software world since the 1980s. At least then, in theory, one developer could know a machine to the metal.<br /><br />http://www.loper-os.org/?p=55<br /><br />While it's true that languages, libraries, and hardware can inhibit development, I suspect that the problem is ultimately one of will and imagination.  The great thing about the early days of personal computing is that the future wasn't certain and people were willing to experiment with hardware, with languages, and with architectures to get a piece of it.  I don't think the will to go back and reinvent is there anymore to the same degree.<br /><br />Modules, libraries, and object-oriented programming have enabled us to pile structures on structures to build things -- but the resulting structures are, like Alan Kay has said, more like Egyptian pyramids than Gothic cathedrals.<br /><br />I don't offer any solutions -- just sharing your frustration!<br /><br /></div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=c1e9c14ae4fedc41d15e9078d50cc705&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Iian</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="3d5a52e3-4dcb-4ff6-8ccb-4c37550b0b64"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 00:14:10 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Yay.

I run the quality assurance program for a product that absolutely positively must work every single time.  No excuses, no exceptions.  There are well-known solutions to guarantee few or no defects (see DO-178C or AS9100C), but they come at a very high cost.  Part of that high cost is generally that the product has the smallest feature set that gets the job done.  Most customers aren't willing to pay for quality at all, let alone quality like that.  <br /><br />But you'd better hope that the software flying the airplane you're about to board was developed like that.  </div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=684579a16f1f10cb229ba40786bb3515&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.oolanzimmer.com">Oolan Zimmer</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="4f3c5fc8-a5ae-48c8-bcea-6501b4497d95"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 00:39:13 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Successful systems get more complex not less. If you switch platforms to a product with fewer features/less complexity you might experience fewer problems. However, the new product will eventually get bloated.<br /><br />Systems are like closets, except they can only handle so much complexity instead of stuff. The complexity in a system rises to it's carrying capacity. New features must be balanced with a reduction in complexity or the removal of older features. When does a system ever drop a feature?<br /><br />This is probably been stated by someone else at some other time, but the what the heck, let's call this principle the Childs Law in the slim chance someone hasn't said it better. Childs Law: 'Complexity rises until the system fails.'<br /><br />Simplicity isn't a feature. Reliability is a feature. There is a strong correlation between the two.  However, it is difficult if not impossible to add simplicity to a system.  One can add features, but one can't add simplicity. It's usually easier to just start over. Of course, then it is hard to call it the same system.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f45f4f4eb033b89b0ed41ff91619188&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">justin</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="f1ef8884-d53b-40d3-b973-389799046e85"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 01:27:58 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">You should get an Android phone ... you'll probably end up with a gun in your mouth after about 3 days of trying to operate it.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=10fe7656b0d040cd668cda56d5c15fc2&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.andrewpull.in">Andrew</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="0cdf67d9-7b43-4f36-a089-dc2f93c35890"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 01:45:50 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">hi, <br /><br />I think the solution is to develop software in Node.js.

I won't read all of them because I can't. To digest every one of these is going to take hours. Even to scan through them will probably take an hour and that's time I don't have. This is one problem.<br /><br />The ecosystem that we've built up and learned to live with is at the heart of a lot of these things, and I might go out on a limb to say it's the entire cause. It's not one piece of software acting up. Or Microsoft and Apple together on one machine. It's the combined junk from everything all running together co-habitating but not in a nice way.<br /><br />Take one piece of software. It goes though a lifecycle. Code is written, scenarios are dreamt up, tests are performed. Lather, rinse, repeat. A software release of fair quality is put out there and it becomes integrated into the collective, your computer. Your computer that runs a bevy of other software, drivers, utilities, that probably nobody else runs that combination. Your computer that combined with it's hardware and software produces one of a million combinations where only 10 or 100 combinations were tested in the labs before the software got out into the wild.<br /><br />Think about the ecosystem of society. Legal, financial, social, healthcare, municipal, federal, real estate, transportation, technology. It's complex. Nobody can draw a picture of the world because it's gotten to be so large and grown in so many dimensions that even when you look at it, it changes.<br /><br />A computer system running a single OS already starts off as a complex society. Dozens of drivers and services running, interfaces to hardware, memory, SSDs, hard drives, CD-ROMs, Blu-Ray, USB, monitor, etc. Layer on top of that more services and memory resident programs and drivers and applications. Layer onto the hardware compatibility services, messaging buses that communicate to other services and make use of the Internet and all the communications protocols that entails. Layer onto that software that continues to run in the background and all the complexities of task switching, idle processing, sleep and wait states, hibernation and restoration.<br /><br />That's a lot going on.<br /><br />Now toss a single wrench in the middle and watch so many of the pieces break, either directly or indirectly.<br /><br />Now multiply that effect 10 times across your entire system.<br /><br />You now have a day in the life of your computer. It's no wonder things break as they do. I sometimes am amazed some of this stuff even works at some (and many times it doesn't).<br /><br />IMHO it's not one thing or even a combination of things that causes this. It's the entire collection of *stuff* and how it all interacts. Many times in ways we have no idea how, let alone debug and fix some of this stuff.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=ccd2cb208bf8f9e680d5a96ba5f62065&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser">Bil Simser</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="cf9c1d09-a53a-46fc-b594-7309f0f4da90"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 03:56:14 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Yes and yes. It's all broken. I run into this stuff all the time - different stuff, but same idea. I'm a developer... my personal universe includes a number of Windoze machines, some Android goodies, and a new Macbook Air which hasn't had a chance to disgrace itself recently. <br /><br />At work, use Java EE (ugh!). I find myself creating stuff that can't work robustly, because of constraints put on by management or poor architecture choices.<br /><br />On the side, I do embedded work in C with marginally acceptable tools from Microchip. My embedded stuff does work, because it really, really, really has too - but the embedded software in my new 60&quot; TV, every DVR I've ever seen, and my blu ray player was all done by baboons, as far as I can tell.<br /><br />I do Android app work (Radar Alive Pro is my first), again with marginal tools (the Mac in the house is partly here in hopes that Android device driver issues in windows won't happen on it).<br /><br />I think that fundamentally, the world is just moving really fast. People want new and more and quality of software is down the list a ways (or, by now, most folks are beaten down by the lack of it and unconsciously just assume everything will be hosed).<br /><br />One sad thought is that technology management usually imagines that they understand this stuff, and maybe, somewhere, they do. <br /><br />What's scary is that really important stuff is probably in just as bad shape - infrastructure systems, for example, or banking. How about nuclear early warning systems - you do know that the US and Russia are still at launch-on-warning status, right? And even the thought of software, developed under high pressure, doing high speed trading should make everyone take all their money and hide it in their mattress (currency or gold, your choice).</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f553558d3e13de63e8595027f8d7aab8&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">John Moore</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="d261b5c8-77f1-4bae-b832-a72301a344f5"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 06:05:10 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">@Chris Poland - Windows 8 doesn't work the way you describe. I think when you actually use it you'll find it's a lot more intuitive than that. For instance, you absolutely never have to hover in corners. That's only if you're first learning the system and need the hint, and even then the hint appears *immediately* with no hovering.<br /><br />To go to Start, you just throw the mouse in the corner and click. No hovering. It's the exact same motion you did in Windows 7 or earlier (unless you made things more difficult than was needed and actually make the effort to target the old button). There is no easier thing you can do with a mouse than click a corner of the screen, and it works *anywhere*.

OSS is no better in terms of quality, it has bigger internal flamewars, and it still requires enormous technical skill to actually fix anything (or, more importantly, find the real problem to fix in the first place). OSS developers seem to think that everyone can just grab a code editor and fix problems. That's what got us into this mess in the first place!<br /><br />Building quality into software is hard &amp; requires passionate people <u>who know the domain in which they are working</u>. It requires diligence and consideration of 'so what if' scenarios, and we just don't have the language constructs to <i>simply</i> specify good code. It's <i>too easy</i> to write poor code, code that works for one given test case but nothing else, and how many of us have spent days/weeks/months reinventing the wheel because of some arbitrary reason (usually because the existing wheel isn't quite the right colour)?<br /><br />I have had the privilege of working in places where developers genuinely care about bugs and fixing their code, and also watched as this is eroded by the addition of developers who just hack code until it passes a unit test, and managerial practices that don't care about quality at all. If it's not a shiny feature being shipped, it doesn't get onto the roadmap. Fighting tooth &amp; nail to get time allocated to write proper unit tests or fix an architectural problem wears you down when the manager is always saying 'but what business benefit does this give us?'. It reduces motivation when it's more vital to have a pretty interface reinvented every year (*cough*Visual Studio*/cough*) than actual performance bugs addressed.<br /><br />I understand where they're coming from - today if you're not first to market with the latest &amp; greatest, you lose out, and that has real job consequences. It's just not conducive to good quality software. I guess it's a question of whether we still seek to be craftsmen/women, or just paid to do a job.<br /><br />It can change. It has to start with the users though. I remember an anecdote (which may or may not be true) about how 3DS Max had become so buggy that the users revolted and told Autodesk 'please, just fix the bugs'. They had two years of releases where they just fixed crashes &amp; improved performance. How many of us would wish for users like that?</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=b682a5c8aae0b74c35fc340e4c3d2ac2&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Jeff Hotchkiss</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="9b7c1d1c-3bec-4d7e-86c2-599fd6fc2a00"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 08:28:38 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Excellent post,though it came up twice in feed ;)<br /><br />On a serious note, Scott you are absolutely correct in noticing and voicing concern about it.

For those that believe that's going to fix things frankly aren't paying attention to the world around them.  Building things that work for all people in all situations is a difficult problem.  Fixing things that don't work for some people some of the time is nearly impossible. But we're not unique in this.<br /><br />Take my Toyota van - wonderfully engineered in many ways, but you cannot stand under the trunk and load groceries when it's raining without getting wet.  Take my wife's favorite gum - the packaging requires you to pop the pieces through aluminum which is left sharp and jagged and easily cuts you.  Take my flat panel TV - it's great except that the form factor is too small for quality speakers, so there's no opportunity for space saving from a CRT if you want quality sound.  These are all engineering problems and UX problems.  Software is not unique in this.<br /><br />Humans generally can't build things perfectly, and that's okay.  No really - it's okay.   Why?  Because we're adaptable and can learn from our mistakes.  What we need to do is adopt a mentality of continous improvement - from a design perspective AND from a user perspective.  And we also need to lighten up a bit and recognize perfection is not attainable.  And the persuit of it, while worthwhile, is never cheap.  Lighten up.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=d23b2cf9de6548618d481fd39afd5d66&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://mattmc3.blogspot.com">mattmc3</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="abba484d-8cf2-4c6f-af44-226808b11a1f"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 12:03:02 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">So switch to Linux :).

A good example is WinRT. With development systems like Visual Studio which weight in at over 2 gigabytes, with API docs which rival an encyclopedia and most programming languages over dependent upon OOP, I do not see how one can create software which is maintainable. While OOP has its place, sadly modern programming languages have allowed OOP to take over, adding complexity to software. Having been a WIN32 developer for nearly 10 years I find good old WIN32 code easier to understand than any of the modern OOP based languages. The easier it is to understand and read the code we write the more likely it will be easier to maintain and debug. Lastly, debugging is an art.

However, the question which is apparently put to the reader is mostly rhetorical.<br /><br />Software is doing incredible things for us. Applications are pushed out to the market all the time, for all popular computing platforms, at a dazzling frequency. This is an age of exploration, pushing the boundaries, redefining information technology. Naturally, there are many quirks and 'oopsies', but the overall experience is far beyond what most of us (computer professionals) anticipated just 15 years ago.<br /><br />I don't think that it's possible to have this rate of innovation and experimentation, without the kinds of problems you've described. I write &quot;kinds&quot; in plural because the sw industry has many issues - old codebases bogged down by backward compatibility (or simply cases of &quot;Boris no longer works here&quot;), groundbreaking code written by people whose technical skills are not on par with their creativity, the urgency to be &quot;out there&quot; before the idea pops up elsewhere and many other scenarios. <br /><br />So QA is not sufficient, some developers are not committed to fixing bugs, some companies make calculated decisions to ditch an old user base - sh*t happens. Overall, we're living in an IT heaven, data is unbelievably accessible, social tools make the lives of many people much richer than they'd have been just a decade ago, there's an infinite supply of free entertainment, discussions, creativity tools, art, teaching... really, the odd restart or spinning wait icon are way more than a fair tradeoff.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">(David *)Frenkiel</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="f4338ce5-4d14-47ee-8cde-3f2225d2327b"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 14:19:36 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">software partly sucks because of the way big tech companies treat their employees.

That's no more than 1-2 defects per product, it's hardly what you would call the end of the software developers world as we know it!<br /><br />There's also the fact that a 'lot' of the problems (as touched on by previous commentary) are down to the amazing number of combinations of running software/hardware, there are probably hundreds of potential things that could go wrong given those combinations.<br /><br />I guess what I'm saying is that it's not strictly true that standards and testing have dropped across the board, some scenarios are either unreasonable to test (or too expensive to cover) to warrant such an effort.<br /><br />I would hazard a guess that most software companies either lack the capacity/money or willingness to handle these edge cases, and to be honest I don't blame them, the software I use works 99% of the time, the 1% that doesn't is usually something I can live without or can forgive them for that hiccup.<br /><br />Writing software today is more difficult than 10, 20 years ago, there's so many platforms, devices and potential pitfalls.

Just in case anyone didn't know, you do have to keep making new iPhoto libraries. It's easy. Hold down the option button while opening iPhoto and you can make new ones, switch, etc.<br /><br />Using smaller libraries makes iMovie work better too...if You also put videos in iPhoto and then pull them into iMovie. If you have ever had your SOUND disappear in iMovie, that's why ~ it happens when the iPhoto library you are connecting it to gets too large.<br /><br />Good luck meh!<br /><br />@Zaneology</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cf1860ea2b7d62d82b5cbd7381872071&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="Http://Zaneology.com">Zane Aveton</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="4f11df86-07c0-44c6-af8d-471f47484d50"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 18:21:35 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">We're too busy writing code for the 80% of features users don't need, for lack of good specs or just because it's more fun to write.

In general, programs do not self-limit working set size for caches.  You can identify where the data is living in the settings tab on a per application basis; fixing it depends on whether the application supports constraints/throwing away cache.  In general, you probably need to be using a different App or report it to the vendor.<br /><br />Your second problem occurs when you are using different versions of the Apple Contacts data formats between devices.  The most common case comes down to two machines with different versions of the OS sharing a common home directory, but you can also see an interaction with iPhone / iPod / iPad / laptop / desktop for similar reasons.  This comes down to the use of SQLite, which is not a real database, and so in general is not arranged to use subschema.  Apple has a data-centric model, unlike the Microsoft library-centric model, and so when you need to talk to data, you are talking to an app.  In other parlance, it's a lack of separations between model and controller.  This is the same reason you can't annotate a song in your iTunes library to say &quot;from 1:35 to 1:55 of this song is a ringtone&quot; without iTunes coming unglued and rebuilding your data indices.  Basically there's no graceful upgrade/downgrade for the local copies of the database in the cloud.<br /><br />Your iMessage problem is a side effect of the duplicate contact information.  Resolve that and you've resolved the iMessage problem.<br /><br />The Outlook problem is specific to the model Outlook uses.  Instead of fully validating container objects, which would require downloading the full container, it starts assigning meaning to the data while it's in flight.  This has the effect of immediate gratification, since it can start rendering the messages immediately.  For content-transfer encoded MIME data, that means two things: (1) Malformed data can crash Outlook, and (2) Security is poor: malformed data can be easily used to attack your system with local code execution exploits.  While a lot of work has gone into patching exploits, there are always new plugins and MIME types which result in more problems.  External renderers are the solution the iPhone chose; there are other equally valid solutions that would prevent problems, intentional or otherwise, but which are not implemented.  Most companies tend to rely on their mail servers to massage the data to avoid the problem, but that's just a spackle-it-over solution.<br /><br />The iPhoto Photo Stream issue is, I think, a misunderstanding on your part.  No photos will be kept past 30 days unless you save them to your local camera roll.  What that means is that if you take photos on an iPhone, and then go back and look at them on some other device, there's going to be more photos on your iPhone after the 30 day limit because they are in the local camera roll, but the other devices which only access them via the Photo Stream will only have the last 30 days.  This appears to be a confusing point for a lot of people who expect that their photos will instead be replicated to all of their devices (&quot;Synced&quot;) instead of merely streamed (Photo _Stream_, not Photo _Sync_).<br /><br />The Outlook outbox is all about Outlooks broken offline model.  Mail.App does both better on this, and worse on other things.  Frankly, most mail programs these days are underwhelming unless you are willing to run older programs.  If you use Mail.App, for example, you'll definitely want to disable presence notification, especially if you have a lot of mail, since it will be blinking the green dot on and off for all the messages, not just the ones in your viewable scrolling area.<br /><br />For GMail slowness, all I can say is that it has major assumptions about two things: (1) JavaScript is fast, and (2) Flash is available.  The second is there for a relatively stupid reason: It's a hack to work around the copy-to-pasteboard, which for security reasons is not permitted to JavaScript.  So they route around the problem by having some things written in Flash.  At a guess you are accessing GMail via IE9 rather than using Chrome with the VP8 JavaScript acceleration.  FWIW, it's possible to kill off the slow components by telling GMail to use &quot;HTML Only&quot;, which will restore a lot of speed.  I'd recommend avoiding using offline GMail.<br /><br />Can't help you with Lync.<br /><br />The Final Cut Pro issue is running UI in a plugin thread which is not the main thread.  You need to seriously consider not running the plugin.  Meanwhile you should report this to Apple, since there will be CrashReporter logs.  They may not do anything about it (when I was on the kernel team at Apple it took moving Heaven and Earth to get them to stop using a deprecated API), but then again, they may surprise you.  These people generally care about good user experience and stable product, when they are made aware of issues.<br /><br />No idea on your Calendar.  Typically this type of thing follows from a Corporate LDAP server that puts up iCal records for everyone in the companies birthday, but couldn't tell you for sure.<br /><br />iPhoto being unusable with a lot of photos probably ties back to your address book issue: I expect that you are using an older version of the OS on one of your machines.  My understanding was this was fixed in a more recent version by doing cell-based rendering so as to not try to render everything, even if it's not user visible in a scrolling region.<br /><br />The Word documents are probably a version mismatch; the easiest thing to do, if they are not confidential, is to use http://www.zamzar.com/conversionTypes.php to convert them to an older version of .doc.  This may not work for you, it really depends on the root cause of the failure.  The typical response when you have this issue, if it's in fact the machine you used to write them in the first place, is to do a &quot;Repair Install&quot; of Word, which will fix any plugins and will fix and doc type associations.<br /><br />Web site browser lockups are a common side effect of adblocking software and of URL rewriting software; make sure you are not using a proxy you did not expect to be using in your browser.  The adblock tends to fail if they use an onLoad clause to verify their ad has loaded, and you've blocked it.  This is typically a coding error in the adblock software.<br /></div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=16c12777d5b1b7a5c2db69282167d296&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Terry Lambert</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="87f20f16-a2b7-4278-93cc-c449a980225e"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 20:23:08 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Too long, turned into a blog post. </div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=aa1e8277c672507d6a38fa6e60e6ec37&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://lazycoder.com">Scott Koon</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="68eb976e-9e86-47c4-9fd9-7623736a8be6"></a>Tuesday, 18 September 2012 20:24:04 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">It is a tax for the &quot;Deliver In Time&quot; approach.

Programming languages have become cryptic. Rather than make coding syntax easier or libraries easier to use, they are more complex. Having been first exposed to programming in the late 1970's and then really getting deep into it in the mid 1980's, I have seen how we have grown from the early home computers, to CPM, to DOS, to 16 bit Windows, 32 bit and now 64 bit Windows. Writing full blow complex UI's in DOS , limited to text only, now that was not easy. We had to build our own menuing systems, windowing systems, printer engines from scratch. <br /><br />Now I thought Visual Basic was great and it was easy compared to programming in DOS. I moved on to pure Windows API programming, while the world went crazy about dot.net. Didn't work with another Microsoft language for a decade (I use a non-Microsoft language). Recently tried to play with the latest Visual Studio so I could try out building Metro apps. It was an absolute shock to the system. Definitely not easier ! The minimal OOP in VB for GUI stuff was great. Now everything is an object and coding is a nightmare. Can't see how anyone can write maintainable code anymore.

However, I think we have ended up with an evolving too complex system based on too many pieces not under the developers control.  To make it worse the fragmentation of the industry and OS creators including Microsoft has pushed development into the Web sphere where one has to spend 3 times as much time on average developing software using too many complex tools.  Just think of it: HTML, Java Script, jQuery, various security API's, C# or VB, Webservices, AJAX, SQL, Database Access, the list goes on.  What we need is one common development platform and new OS platform that is greatly simplified.  Then we can get back to creating clean code.

The industry has changed in a way when skills are more and more specialised but development projects think they will get a developer who will be an expert in everything when the reality is they are likely to be competent in a small number of technologies and can just about get by in others but the project will expect them to do everything.<br />Would you expect a brick layer to do the plumming on a house?<br /><br />A lot of the comments about management are things i see regularly and it is frightening sometimes.<br /><br />I also think outsourcing has a contributed to this problem a lot too.<br /><br />Its a simple idea really, good teams with good people and reasonable processes tend to write decent software.  Bad teams with poor quality people and poor development processes will write rubbish software.  Most companies cant measure the difference between these two scenarios so tend to go for the second because its cheaper on paper and easier to sell to their equally out of their depth manager. </div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=76301df8b9861b1722ac1c4f1d85eb92&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">joe bloggs</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="6ef58f2f-30d5-4327-8ee8-5574d42ee40d"></a>Wednesday, 19 September 2012 18:08:37 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I agree that complexity and amplitude are good reasons that it is happening, however, not why it is happening. <br /><br />In my humble opinion, the cause is corruption.

Everything about it is geared to spitting out code as fast as possible and QA be damned the closer to release you get.  You end up with an endless cycle of releases that come a little bit closer to the actual planned and QAed release.<br /><br />For a rough example; Windows 8 is 'mostly' what Microsoft planned as the next OS after XP but what we got was years of getting incrementally closer: XP sp1, sp2, sp3, Windows Vista, Vista sp1, Windows 7, SP1.  While all the releases are being planned by the project managers all the quality code gets shoved aside, luckily some slips through.<br /><br />It's true that if you held the release for code the programmer was completely happy with nothing would ever be released, all this Agile has to be done right now, work 18 hour days just ends up with code where none of the corner cases ever get tested.  </div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=176b02e49ae5d8630c668257521724d9&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><a class="commentPermalinkStyle" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.KD0JOF.com">Paul Davis</a></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="aee89d96-c057-4d6e-b65f-ace450a1ed1d"></a>Thursday, 20 September 2012 06:14:26 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">There is a guy named Xah Lee.

There are a lot of people doing it who aren't really up to it (though they are JUST good enough to produce working code in the minimal sense).<br />2. our computation model is binary, brittle, and unable to spontaneously adapt to new conditions. This won't change until a revolution occurs. As a result, even well-written and -tested code breaks when it encounters something unexpected, which is guaranteed to happen eventually.<br />and 3. the pressure to get to market quickly, and hopefully avoid irrelevance, is just tremendous right now, during this period of rapid, disruptive change.

In that experience I've worked on many teams and many applications and nearly all of them have sucked painfully. <br /><br />At the pace the state workforce moves, we can't even blame <i>time to market</i> like the fast moving private sector might. There are even occasions when a project is stretched across a fiscal year for budget protection, because with the State money unspent is clipped from next year’s allowance.<br /><br />We simply ignore quality, even security, because most of state staff are the pseudo-devs you speak of. In fact, because I've worked here so long, when I compare myself to the skill levels of my peers and mentors, I often feel like I am one myself. <br /><br />The State cannot retain truly legit developers because their projects are often lame and driven by back-pocket friendships or legislature, rather than by business use or duty to the public as we've been charged. <br /><br />It's sad really; and I'm sad for the same reason... because I know we can... and more because our duty is to serve California, because <i>we should</i>.<br /></div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=17ca6ad04e6a3b6f75d47cf3bc0ec5f7&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Trey White</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="cc26665c-b896-47de-b154-736925b65336"></a>Wednesday, 26 September 2012 13:21:15 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">@Trey:<br /><br />Replace &quot;legislature&quot; with &quot;Board of Directors,&quot; and everything you just said applies to private companies equally.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=e19dd5718d67d4810aaf7a2691418d1a&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">K</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="6a89538d-a77a-403d-b756-6bfc493a25b6"></a>Wednesday, 26 September 2012 14:00:28 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">There are only so many pitchers good enough to make the major leagues.

And that's just the ones there's already a mechanisms for.<br />We could invent new mechanisms for other ways that don't exist yet.  Want to encourage someone to take on the task of developing an app you need?  Eliminate their ROI risk by offering an &quot;X&quot; prize with funds collected from presales.

Get laws passed that force them to accept returns of their SW, one justifiable reason being that it was too buggy to be useable.<br /><br />Like I said, address the problem -- that people accept buying broken SW.

Time to start shorting stock, need to find some Apple LEAPs, their day is coming, Microsoft's is here.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=64d9975deccb1123cdcfb0ea5e0a6841&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Bruce Sands</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="43673bd2-3146-49e8-8449-2a839bce68b5"></a>Saturday, 20 October 2012 07:02:19 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Apple is a joke, you can't even change the font size on some applications, you're sitting in front of a $2000 toy need your reading glasses to read the font, what a joke company, their day is coming, too much money and too much arrogance.<br /><br />As someone commented above, stay very simple, avoid bloated crap, avoid the cloud, </div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=64d9975deccb1123cdcfb0ea5e0a6841&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Bruce Sands</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="124764f0-b2b8-41b5-b7ea-de15a73ad163"></a>Tuesday, 01 January 2013 18:26:15 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">The iMessage bug you're mentioning is sooo annoying! ..and it is NOT a side effect of the duplicate contacts as someone else suggested.

Have been for years!<br /><br />But you can change your thinking and realize what you've described is an opportunity.  To create new, well-crafted systems that really work, all the time, without the pain.  It's not easy, and takes a mix of logic, art and intuition.  But the result is something that truly differentiates itself in a way that marketing veneer just can't match.<br /><br />In the grand scheme of things, software development is still a relatively nascent field compared to other areas of engineering.  Just look at the wealth of formal validation techniques used in Electrical Engineering.  Our tools are just getting there.<br /><br />So while I can't give you back your 3 gigs of iPhone space, hopefully I can provide 770 bytes of inspiration.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=88917f99ed5443dcf8e6f29cf23f6cf8&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Richard Kagerer</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="a4f8c927-468c-42c7-95dd-c08d93f27089"></a>Tuesday, 05 February 2013 12:02:17 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">I very much agree - most of the software out there is more or less crap.<br /><br />I think another reason why so many software is erroneous is because changes of all kind always introduce usability issues: Usability is all about meeting the user expectations. Every change you do requires the long time expert users of your software to adjust to the new application behavior, so even if you greatly enhance the usability when looking from a new user's point of view, old users might get confused and feel distracted by the change. Hence it's much easier to introduce new features than to correct design flaws done years ago.<br /><br />My solution? Continue to sell what you have, while re-implementing it in the background from the scratch, as Apple did with OS X. Just don't be afraid to break with the old conventions and principles - people who don't like the new approach can stay with the old one!<br /><br />And remember what Einstein said: &quot;We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.&quot;<br /><br />Daniel</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=9d847e754fce28f0f00a57d3fd2c230e&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">Daniel</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="79510595-5df9-4a63-99bb-9f5f1fa06f4c"></a>Tuesday, 07 May 2013 01:56:29 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Yes, I care and, have a few friends who do too. Of course, we work in software. I find it amazing the diversity of views on this issue. This tells me we do not have a grip on it. I actually think that the industry is so overwhelmed by itself that we are heading for some form of cascading failures when the collective quality gets bad enough and somebody forces an automatic upgrade upon us that sets off the cascade. I am working at a place that is progressively loosing the quality battle. And we all know it but cannot seem to get a grip on it. <br /> Recently, I read Jared Diamonds book 'Collapse' and find it notable that when I society is loosing it, that they cannot take enough risk to act on their problems and seem to resort to superstitious behavior. Companies do that too. Bug scrubbing becomes like a religion or like trench warfare, and we cant break out of the loop. I also think that products have life cycles, that entropy rules , and that every code base has a point where the company should just stop, because dinking it is just gonna make it worse.</div><div class="commentBoxFooterStyle"><span class="commentGravatarBlock"><img class="commentGravatar" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=15fd552982bb8e01e112df0359b8db85&rating=PG&size=110&default=identicon"/></span><span class="commentPermalinkStyle">CodeMole</span></div></div><div class="commentBoxStyle"><div class="commentDateStyle"><a name="bb244de4-c4b7-440c-8dd5-3a1514debe25"></a>Monday, 15 July 2013 08:45:54 UTC</div><div class="commentBodyStyle">Couldn't agree more than that.

But, almost by definition, the amount of competence among users and technical folk has been growing at a human pace, i.e., slowly.
