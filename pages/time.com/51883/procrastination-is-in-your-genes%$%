    <h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">A study by researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder has found that a tendency to procrastinate is affected by genetic factors, which are also linked to a propensity to be impulsive</h2>
    <aside class="right-rail-module rr-taboola-video" data-name="rr-taboola-video"><div id="taboola-right-rail-organic-video-51883" class="taboola" data-mode="verticalx3" data-placement="right-rail-organic" data-type="video"></div></aside><p>Everybody has put off today what can be done tomorrow. And that might be because procrastination is in your genes, a new study published in the journal <em>Psychological Science</em> suggests.</p>
<p>But when it comes to delaying, not everyone is created equal. Some are significantly more likely to procrastinate than others, so researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder looked into whether this bad habit might have its roots in genetics by surveying 181 identical twin pairs and 166 fraternal twin pairs. The twins were surveyed on their ability to set and maintain goals, propensity to procrastinate and impulsivity.</p>
<p>Prior research has indicated that procrastination and impulsivity are genetically linked. Being impulsive has an evolutionary advantage, the researchers point out, because it would have helped our ancestors with everyday survival. Procrastination, on the other hand, may be more of a modern phenomenon, since we now focus on long-term goals, from which we can easily get distracted.</p>
<p>Based on the behavioral similarities in twins, the researchers concluded that procrastination can indeed be genetic, and that it seems to have some genetic overlap with impulsivity. The researchers also suggest that procrastination is an evolutionary by-product of making the rash decisions that go along with being impulsive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Learning more about the underpinnings of procrastination may help develop interventions to prevent it, and help us overcome our ingrained tendencies to get distracted and lose track of work,&#8221; study author Daniel Gustavson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Now the only thing chronic procrastinators might care about is, will there ever be a cure?</p>

Such offerings, which often include stand-alone vision and dental care, are becoming healthcare game changers in an increasingly complex marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) established healthcare exchanges, providing multiple new ways for companies to secure benefits. Today, companies can choose to use a public or private exchange\u2014or continue to purchase directly from an insurance provider\u2014based on their specific needs. That flexibility comes in handy for companies that, for example, want to streamline medical coverage through an exchange but are looking to fill in coverage gaps by purchasing benefits like vision directly.<\/p>\n<p>Whether companies choose to purchase through an exchange or directly, the important thing is to make sure your benefit package is complete. Doing so can offer some significant advantages for both companies and their employees. For example, companies are able to attract and retain employees with a <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/content-from\/vsp\/2818373\/mid-cycle-enrollments-a-breeze-for-companies\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:blue;\">rich benefits package<\/span><\/a>. At the same time, these ancillary benefits also offer hidden value. Many systemic conditions are detected first through vision and dental examinations. A 2013 study by Human Capital Management Services, Inc. (HCMS)<sup>1<\/sup> found that 62 percent of the time, doctors for vision-care provider VSP Vision Care detected signs of high cholesterol before other healthcare providers recorded the condition.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, VSP early detection rates were 34 percent for diabetes and 39 percent for hypertension. The study also showed that the patients identified through an eye exam entered the health care system with fewer complications and co-occurring illnesses, and experienced lower rates of inpatient admissions and emergency room visits. The study also verified that keeping these employees healthier reduced absenteeism and turnover while increasing productivity while at work.<\/p>\n<p>The HCMS study found that for every initial $1 spent by clients on exam services, they saved $1.45 in improved productivity and reduced healthcare costs over a four-year span. This translates to a 145 percent return on the initial dollar investment. The total savings of the six companies in the study over four years was $13.1 million.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise, then, that more and more companies have begun to add ancillary products to their benefits mix. In fact, since 2008 the number of companies offering such products has doubled.<\/p>\n<p>Not all ancillary plans are created equal, though. It\u2019s important to find a benefits partner that can deliver the products and services that companies and their employees care about most. For example, delivering on consumer priorities like low out of pocket costs and the ability to personalize their benefit help drive satisfaction and utilization, which in turn, helps employers attract and retain top performers \u2013 and keep them healthy and productive.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><sup>1<\/sup>Human Capital Management Services, 2013 Study of VSP Eye Health Management Program<\/p>","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/isp2004637_ofw.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/isp2004637_ofw.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/isp2004637_ofw.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/isp2004637_ofw.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/isp2004637_ofw.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"www.imagesource.com","caption":"","alt":"Businesspeople in a meeting"},"id":2914279,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Fvsp%2F2914279%2Fflexible-benefits-packages-serve-your-employees-best%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nyXp8Q","encoded_title":"Flexible+Benefits+Packages+Serve+Your+Employees+Best","twitter_text":"Flexible%20Benefits%20Packages%20Serve%20Your%20Employees%20Best","twitter_via":"TIME","sponsor":{"name":"VSP","slug":"vsp","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/vsplogowhclr_300dpi.png?w=38","color":"#9e9e9e"},"email_title":"Flexible%20Benefits%20Packages%20Serve%20Your%20Employees%20Best%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Flexible%20Benefits%20Packages%20Serve%20Your%20Employees%20Best%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Fvsp%2F2914279%2Fflexible-benefits-packages-serve-your-employees-best%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/content-from\/the-lincoln-motor-company\/2859829\/becoming-one-with-nature\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1s6bG4H","title":"Becoming One with Nature","post_type":"time_sponsored_post","short_title":"Becoming One with Nature","time":{"pretty":"June 16, 2014","published":"2014-06-16 18:32:06","updated":"2014-06-16 22:32:06","minute":"6:32 pm","short":"6\/16"},"content":"<p>Customized kayaks with passion and purpose<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"4\"><object id=\"bc-video--4\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3621523895001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1s6bG4H\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p>Taking the properties of nature into account, Nick Schade is making modern-day kayaks that hearken back to another time.<\/p>\n","id":2859829,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Fthe-lincoln-motor-company%2F2859829%2Fbecoming-one-with-nature%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1s6bG4H","encoded_title":"Becoming+One+with+Nature","twitter_text":"Becoming%20One%20with%20Nature","twitter_via":"TIME","sponsor":{"name":"The Lincoln Motor Company","slug":"the-lincoln-motor-company","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/12linc_star_4c_411_r01_v10.png?w=9","color":"#9e9e9e"},"email_title":"Becoming%20One%20with%20Nature%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Becoming%20One%20with%20Nature%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Fthe-lincoln-motor-company%2F2859829%2Fbecoming-one-with-nature%2F"}],"single_article":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/51883\/procrastination-is-in-your-genes\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1hxj4uD","title":"Procrastination Is in Your Genes","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Procrastination Is in Your Genes","excerpt":"A study by researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder has found that a tendency to procrastinate is affected by genetic factors, which are also linked to a propensity to be impulsive","format":"brief","time":{"pretty":"April 7, 2014","published":"2014-04-07 13:36:39","updated":"2014-04-07 17:36:39","minute":"1:36 pm","short":"4\/7"},"authors":[{"id":207020909,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/alexandra-sifferlin\/","name":"Alexandra Sifferlin","bio":"Alexandra Sifferlin is a reporter for TIME covering all things health-related.

And that might be because procrastination is in your genes, a new study published in the journal <em>Psychological Science<\/em> suggests.<\/p>\n<p>But when it comes to delaying, not everyone is created equal. Some are significantly more likely to procrastinate than others, so researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder looked into whether this bad habit might have its roots in genetics by surveying 181 identical twin pairs and 166 fraternal twin pairs. The twins were surveyed on their ability to set and maintain goals, propensity to procrastinate and impulsivity.<\/p>\n<p>Prior research has indicated that procrastination and impulsivity are genetically linked. Being impulsive has an evolutionary advantage, the researchers point out, because it would have helped our ancestors with everyday survival. Procrastination, on the other hand, may be more of a modern phenomenon, since we now focus on long-term goals, from which we can easily get distracted.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the behavioral similarities in twins, the researchers concluded that procrastination can indeed be genetic, and that it seems to have some genetic overlap with impulsivity. The researchers also suggest that procrastination is an evolutionary by-product of making the rash decisions that go along with being impulsive.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Learning more about the underpinnings of procrastination may help develop interventions to prevent it, and help us overcome our ingrained tendencies to get distracted and lose track of work,&#8221; study author Daniel Gustavson said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Now the only thing chronic procrastinators might care about is, will there ever be a cure?<\/p>","section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/health\/"},"tag":{"name":"behavior","slug":"behavior","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/behavior\/"},"tags":"behavior|impulsivity|procrastination|Research","id":51883,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F51883%2Fprocrastination-is-in-your-genes%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1hxj4uD","encoded_title":"Procrastination+Is+in+Your+Genes","twitter_text":"Procrastination%20Is%20in%20Your%20Genes","twitter_via":"TIMEHealth","email_title":"Procrastination%20Is%20in%20Your%20Genes%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Procrastination%20Is%20in%20Your%20Genes%0A%0AA%20study%20by%20researchers%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder%20has%20found%20that%20a%20tendency%20to%20procrastinate%20is%20affected%20by%20genetic%20factors%2C%20which%20are%20also%20linked%20to%20a%20propensity%20to%20be%20impulsive%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F51883%2Fprocrastination-is-in-your-genes%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video"}},"latest":{"articles":[{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/2938317\/isis-militants-declare-islamist-caliphate\/","right_now":true,"shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1qoFBnc","title":"ISIS Militants Declare Islamist &#8216;Caliphate&#8217;","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Militants Declare Caliphate","excerpt":"In a move that may attract more followers, the Sunni extremist group claims to establish dominion over all the world's Muslims","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"June 29, 2014","published":"2014-06-29 17:21:07","updated":"2014-06-29 21:21:07","minute":"5:21 pm","short":"6\/29"},"authors":[{"id":207046200,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/karl-vick\/","name":"Karl Vick","bio":"Karl Vick is the Jerusalem Bureau Chief for TIME, covering Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories with occasional forays into other lands.

It now wants to be called simply Islamic State, moving past debates over transliterations of the former title, sometimes rendered as ISIL, for Levant instead of Syria, or al-Shams. Social-media sites like Twitter, which the group has used expertly to amplify its message and sense of a strong following, came alive with a new <em>#<\/em>IS hashtag, while Facebook carried posts <a title=\"Facebook video post \" href=\"https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=674192632662990&amp;id=100002167781426\" target=\"_blank\">claiming to document celebrations<\/a> \u2014 shooting in the air from pickups \u2014 in the streets of Raqqa, the Syrian city the Islamist group has held the longest.<\/p>\n<p>Any further impact will depend on public reaction.

It&#8217;s not hard to imagine Sunday\u2019s announcement, at the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, inspiring young Muslims already inclined toward jihad. \u201cIf they\u2019re a caliphate now, a lot of people, possibly living in America or Europe &#8212; the ones who are already radicalized and inclined to join them, it\u2019s more of an impetus,\u201d al-Khoei tells TIME. \u201cMaybe the publicity stunt will affect recruiting in that sense. There\u2019ll be more eager, young volunteers excited by the sense that it\u2019s here now, it\u2019s a reality now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The fact is, <a title=\"washington post caliphate story 2006\" href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2006\/01\/13\/AR2006011301816.html\" target=\"_blank\">a certain nostalgia for the caliphate<\/a> lingers in much of the Muslim community \u2014 and not only among fundamentalists, or so-called <em>takfiri<\/em> groups like ISIS that see Shi\u2018ite Muslims as apostates. Catholics still have their Pope, these mainstream believers point out, and Eastern Orthodox Christians their patriarch.<\/p>\n<p>But there are Caliphs and there are Caliphs. And while many, like the current Christian leaders, preach peace, the summons from the Mesopotamian desert Sunday was to &#8220;greedily drink the blood&#8221; of nonbelievers according to an early translation <a title=\"pdf ad myreader\" href=\"http:\/\/myreader.toile-libre.org\/uploads\/My_53b039f00cb03.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">posted online<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">&#8220;The sun of jihad has risen &#8230; The glad tidings of good are shining. Triumph looms on the horizon. The signs of victory have appeared. Here the flag of the Islamic State, the flag of tawh\u012bd (monotheism), rises and flutters. Its shade covers land from Aleppo to Diyala.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\u2026 So rush O Muslims and gather around your khal\u012bfah [caliphate], so that you may return as you once were for ages, kings of the earth and knights of war. Come so that you may be honored and esteemed, living as masters with dignity. Know that we fight over a religion that Allah promised to support. We fight for an ummah [global Muslim community] to which Allah has given honor, esteem, and leadership, promising it with empowerment and strength on the earth. Come O Muslims to your honor, to your victory. By Allah, if you disbelieve in democracy, secularism, nationalism, as well as all the other garbage and ideas from the west, and rush to your religion and creed, then by Allah, you will own the earth, and the east and west will submit to you.

He testified that he opened fire after mistakenly thinking there was a dangerous intruder in the toilet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has alleged that Pistorius, 27, killed Steenkamp after a Valentine&#8217;s Day argument, and has portrayed the Olympic athlete as a hothead with a love of guns and an inflated sense of entitlement. But he requested an independent inquiry into Pistorius&#8217; state of mind, based on concern the defense would argue Pistorius was not guilty because of mental illness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of premeditated murder, and could also face years in prison if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing.

target=\"_blank\">Monday's Top 6 News Stories <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>One of the authors of a controversial Facebook study into emotional states published this month has apologized for anxiety caused.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook tweaked the News Feeds of nearly 700,000 users by displaying disproportionately positive or negative statuses for one week in January 2012, to help its researchers understand how emotional states are transmitted on social media. More than 3 million posts were analyzed in the experiment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy co-authors and I are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused. In hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety,\u201d wrote Adam Kramer, one of the three authors, in a Facebook post.<\/p>\n<p>But Kramer also defended the social network\u2019s study. \u201cWe felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out,\u201d he wrote.<\/p>\n<p>Controversy swirled around the social media giant&#8217;s ethics because users were not explicitly asked or notified that they were part of the experiment. Instead, Facebook relied on its terms of service that all users agree to when signing up and allows them to conduct studies like this.<\/p>\n<p>You can read the full post by Kramer here:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>OK so. A lot of people have asked me about my and <a class=\"profileLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jamie.guillory\">Jamie<\/a> and <a class=\"profileLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jeffreyhancock\">Jeff<\/a>\u2019s recent study published in PNAS, and I wanted to give a brief public explanation. The reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of Facebook and the people that use our product. We felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out. At the same time, we were concerned that exposure to friends&#8217; negativity might lead people to avoid visiting Facebook. We didn&#8217;t clearly state our motivations in the paper.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding methodology, our research sought to investigate the above claim by very minimally deprioritizing a small percentage of content in News Feed (based on whether there was an emotional word in the post) for a group of people (about 0.04% of users, or 1 in 2500) for a short period (one week, in early 2012). Nobody&#8217;s posts were &#8220;hidden,&#8221; they just didn&#8217;t show up on some loads of Feed. Those posts were always visible on friends&#8217; timelines, and could have shown up on subsequent News Feed loads. And we found the exact opposite to what was then the conventional wisdom: Seeing a certain kind of emotion (positive) encourages it rather than suppresses is.<\/p>\n<p>And at the end of the day, the actual impact on people in the experiment was the minimal amount to statistically detect it &#8212; the result was that people produced an average of one fewer emotional word, per thousand words, over the following week.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of all of our research at Facebook is to learn how to provide a better service. Having written and designed this experiment myself, I can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone. I can understand why some people have concerns about it, and my coauthors and I are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused. In hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety.<\/p>\n<p>While we\u2019ve always considered what research we do carefully, we (not just me, several other researchers at Facebook) have been working on improving our internal review practices. The experiment in question was run in early 2012, and we have come a long way since then. Those review practices will also incorporate what we\u2019ve learned from the reaction to this paper.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","section":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tech\/"},"tag":{"name":"Social Networking","slug":"social-networking","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/social-networking\/"},"tags":"facebook|Facebook Privacy|privacy|Social Media|Social Networking|study|technology","id":2939100,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F2939100%2Ffacebook-study-emotions-adam-kramer%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1k4maIO","encoded_title":"The+Author+of+a+Controversial+Facebook+Study+Says+He%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98Sorry%E2%80%99","twitter_text":"The%20Author%20of%20a%20Controversial%20Facebook%20Study%20Says%20He%27s%20%E2%80%98Sorry%E2%80%99","twitter_via":"Techland","email_title":"The%20Author%20of%20a%20Controversial%20Facebook%20Study%20Says%20He%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%98Sorry%E2%80%99%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"The%20Author%20of%20a%20Controversial%20Facebook%20Study%20Says%20He%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%98Sorry%E2%80%99%0A%0ABut%20he%20also%20defends%20his%20research%20into%20the%20transmission%20of%20emotional%20states%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F2939100%2Ffacebook-study-emotions-adam-kramer%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/2938804\/costa-rica-beats-greece-5-3-for-quarterfinal-clash-with-dutch\/","right_now":true,"shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1lqJJLV","title":"Costa Rica Beats Greece 5-3 to Advance to Their First Ever World Cup Quarterfinal","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Costa Rica in Quarterfinals After Win Over Greece","excerpt":"The Costa Ricans had to play for almost an hour with 10 men, and just had the legs to win 5-3 on penalties after the match finished level at 1-1 after extra time","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"June 29, 2014","published":"2014-06-29 23:11:50","updated":"2014-06-30 03:11:50","minute":"11:11 pm","short":"6\/29"},"authors":[{"id":193865,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/associated-press\/","name":"Associated Press","bio":"","twitter":"","twitter_url":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":null}],"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-2938804\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p>(RIO DE JANEIRO) \u2014 Regulation time doesn&#8217;t seem to mean much at this stage, judging by the way Netherlands, Costa Rica and Brazil have advanced through the first of the World Cup knockout rounds.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-partner\" data-name=\"rr-partner\"><div class=\"read-more-list\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2938225\/klm-royal-dutch-airlines-gael-garcia-bernal-world-cup\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">KLM Offends Mexico With Dumb World Cup Tweet<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2936342\/suarez-bite-appeal\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Soccer Star Says Biting Italian Player Was an Accident<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/pippa-middleton-exclusive-interview-9-things-we-learned-n144146?cid=par-time_20140630\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Nine Things We Learned From Pippa's First TV Interview <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2014\/06\/28\/world-cup-muslim-fasting_n_5538226.html\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">World Cup's Muslim Players Face Big Challenge With Ramadan Fast <span>Huffington Post<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/know-it-all\/know-it-all-mondays-top-6-stories-nbc-news-n144011?cid=par-time_20140630\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Monday's Top 6 News Stories <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>The Dutch needed a penalty deep in stoppage time to seal a 2-1 comeback win over Mexico and advance to a match against a Costa Rica lineup that beat Greece on penalties later Sunday to reach the World Cup quarterfinals for the first time.

No One Knows<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>That was the second penalty shootout of the weekend, following Brazil&#8217;s narrow win over Chile on Saturday.<\/p>\n<p>In oppressive heat at Fortaleza, a Dutch attack that scored five goals against 2010 champion Spain in its opening game was on the verge of a second-round exit until finding a way past Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa in the 88th minute.<\/p>\n<p>Once they did, the turnaround happened quickly. Wesley Sneijder&#8217;s bullet-like strike canceled out Giovani Dos Santos&#8217; 48th-minute opener for Mexico. Klaas Jan Huntelaar sealed the win with a calmly-taken penalty late in stoppage time after Mexico captain Rafael Marquez took down Robben in the area.<\/p>\n<p>The veteran Dutch forward had been dangerous in attack but all his efforts had been fruitless, as had his frequent tumbles and appeals for penalties and free kicks.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Unbelievable,&#8221; Robben said. &#8220;Five minutes from full time, we were out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It was unbelievable for Mexico coach Miguel Herrera, too. The effusive coach was mystified that the penalty was awarded by referee Pedro Proenca, disputing the contact that resulted in Robben sprawling on the pitch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today it was the man with the whistle who eliminated us from the World Cup,&#8221; Herrera said. &#8220;We ended up losing because he whistled a penalty that did not exist.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I repeat this because (Robben) dived three times. The referee should have cautioned him. If that had happened, Robben would have been cautioned or even sent off.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In recent seasons Robben has been trying to shake off his reputation for diving. Against Mexico, he only compounded it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I have to say, in the first half \u2014 and right away offer my excuses \u2014 I dived,&#8221; he told Dutch broadcaster NOS. &#8220;I mustn&#8217;t do that. It was another stupid action.&#8221; He wasn&#8217;t sorry about the injury-time incident that incensed Mexico and condemned it to its sixth consecutive second-round loss at World Cups.<\/p>\n<p>With temperatures hitting 32 Celsius (90 Fahrenheit) and in 68 percent humidity, FIFA instituted cooling breaks 30 minutes into each half in Fortaleza so players could rehydrate.<\/p>\n<p>Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal used the second-half break to make a tactical change, switching from a 5-3-2 system to a more traditional Dutch 4-4-3, bringing Huntelaar in to replace the tiring Robin van Persie.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, we escaped,&#8221; Van Gaal said. &#8220;But we showed that we could create more chances with 4-3-3, and the players handled this shift very well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Costa Ricans, rank outsiders at the start of the tournament, were fluid in attack as they topped a group containing former champions Italy, Uruguay and England to advance to the knockout stage, but then had to struggle against Greece at Recife.<\/p>\n<p>Costa Rica took an early second-half lead through captain Bryan Ruiz but, after being reduced to 10 men when Oscar Duarte was sent off for his second booking in the 66th minute, conceded an injury-time equalizer to Sokratis Papastathopoulos that sent the match into extra time at 1-1.<\/p>\n<p>The Costa Ricans appeared on the verge of exhaustion as Greece relentlessly pressed forward.<\/p>\n<p>Greece, which sealed its place in the knockout stages for the first time with a late penalty winner against Ivory Coast, couldn&#8217;t find the winner in extra time despite a numerical advantage.<\/p>\n<p>Given a few moments to recover their breath, the Costa Ricans were perfect in the shoot out, with Michael Umana scoring the decisive penalty.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To the entire people in Costa Rica, those at home and out on the streets, this is for you,&#8221; Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto said. &#8220;This is a people that love football and they deserve it. &#8230; We will continue fighting. We will go on.

The report also portrayed the Veterans Affairs Department as a struggling agency battling a corrosive culture of distrust, lacking in resources and ill-prepared to deal with an influx of new and older veterans with a range of medical and mental health care needs.<\/p>\n<p>McDonald&#8217;s nomination was praised by his peers in the private sector and military.<\/p>\n<p>Jim McNerney, Chairman and CEO of The Boeing Company, called McDonald an &#8220;outstanding choice for this critically important position.&#8221; Retired U.S. Army General Stanley McChystal, who served with McDonald in the 82nd Airborne, said the nominee&#8217;s &#8220;business acumen, coupled with his dedication and love of our nation&#8217;s military and veteran community, make him a truly great choice for the tough challenges we have at VA.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, called McDonald &#8220;a good man, a veteran and a strong leader with decades of experience in the private sector. With those traits, he&#8217;s the kind of person who is capable of implementing the kind of dramatic, systemic change that is badly needed and long overdue at the VA.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement that he looked forward to meeting with McDonald next week to get his views on issues he views as important.<\/p>\n<p>Among them, Sanders said in a statement, &#8220;The VA needs significantly improved transparency and accountability and it needs an increased number of doctors, nurses and other medical staff so that all eligible veterans get high-quality health care in a timely manner.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>McDonald led Procter &amp; Gamble from 2009 to 2013. During that time, the company website states: &#8220;P&amp;G realized annual sales of over $84 billion. The company had more than 120,000 employees, 120 plants and 200 brands in 35 categories, of which 25 brands generate over $1 billion in sales each year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and other products can be found in 98 percent of American households. But under McDonald&#8217;s leadership, P&amp;G struggled to grow under increased competition and global economic challenges. Critics suggested he was having trouble getting the 150-year-old-plus company to fire on all cylinders.<\/p>\n<p>Investors, including activist investor William Ackman, voiced frustration over the company&#8217;s slow revenue growth and stagnant market share gains. Ackman, who took a 1 percent stake in the company, pressed for the company to streamline operations and improve results.<\/p>\n<p>In a letter announcing his retirement from P&amp;G, McDonald wrote, &#8220;This has been a very difficult decision for me, but I&#8217;m convinced it is what is in the best interests of the company and you.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a surprise move, McDonald was replaced by the man he had replaced, former P&amp;G CEO A.G. Lafley.<\/p>\n<p>McDonald has also served on the board of directors of the Xerox Corp., the United States Steel Corp., the McKinsey Advisory Council and the Greater Cincinnati regional initiative intended to &#8220;grow high-potential startups&#8221; in the Cincinnati region.<\/p>\n<p>McDonald is 61. A native of Gary, Indiana, he grew up in Chicago and graduated from West Point in 1975 with a degree in engineering. He also earned an MBA from the University of Utah in 1978.<\/p>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/"},"tag":{"name":"Military","slug":"military","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/military\/"},"tags":"Barack Obama|Eric Shineski|Eric Shinseki|Military|Proctor and Gamble|Robert McDonald|Sloan Gibson|Veteran Affairs|Veterans Affairs","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/ap110922124083.jpg?crop=1870px%2C38px%2C3488px%2C3488px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/ap110922124083.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/ap110922124083.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/ap110922124083.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/ap110922124083.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Mark Lennihan\u2014AP","caption":"Robert McDonald, CEO and president of Procter &amp; Gamble, speaks at the Clinton Global Initiative on Sept. 22, 2011 in New York City.","alt":"Robert McDonald, CEO and president of Procter & Gamble, speaks at the Clinton Global Initiative on Sept. 22, 2011 in New York City."},"id":2938351,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F2938351%2Fobama-picks-ex-pg-head-to-lead-veterans-affairs%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2FUYNJ0D","encoded_title":"Obama+Picks+Ex-P%26G+Head+Robert+McDonald+to+Lead+Veterans+Affairs","twitter_text":"Obama%20Picks%20Ex-P%26G%20Head%20Robert%20McDonald%20to%20Lead%20Veterans%20Affairs","twitter_via":"TIMEPolitics","email_title":"Obama%20Picks%20Ex-P%26G%20Head%20Robert%20McDonald%20to%20Lead%20Veterans%20Affairs%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Obama%20Picks%20Ex-P%26G%20Head%20Robert%20McDonald%20to%20Lead%20Veterans%20Affairs%0A%0AIn%20tapping%20McDonald%20for%20the%20post%2C%20Obama%20is%20signaling%20his%20desire%20to%20install%20a%20VA%20chief%20with%20broad%20management%20experience%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F2938351%2Fobama-picks-ex-pg-head-to-lead-veterans-affairs%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-mag"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/2939343\/zendaya-will-not-play-aaliyah-in-tv-film-citing-production-issues\/","right_now":true,"shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1pDD4X1","title":"Zendaya Will Not Play Aaliyah in TV Film Citing &#8216;Production&#8217; Issues","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Disney Star Zendaya Pulls Out of Aaliyah Biopic","excerpt":"Zendaya will no longer play Aaliyah in an upcoming film","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"2:26 AM ET","published":"2014-06-30 02:26:11","updated":"2014-06-30 06:26:11","minute":"2:26 am","short":"2:26 AM ET"},"authors":[{"id":193865,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/associated-press\/","name":"Associated Press","bio":"","twitter":"","twitter_url":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":null}],"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-2939343\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p>(LOS ANGELES) \u2014 Dust yourself off and try again Lifetime Network: Zendaya will no longer play Aaliyah in an upcoming film.<\/p>\n<p>The 17-year-old Disney Channel star said Sunday that she pulled out of the project because &#8220;production-wise, (it) wasn&#8217;t all the way there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s someone that I honor and I respect so much, it has to be 128 percent, especially for all her fans, including myself,&#8221; Zendaya said on her way into the BET Awards, where she&#8217;s up for the Young Stars award. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel like it was all the way there, so I didn&#8217;t want to do that.

It&#8217;s a true winner. The ice cream itself is creamy and tasty but it&#8217;s nothing <em>extraordinary. <\/em>What really makes this treat special, though, is the abundance of chocolate crunchies and generous heaps of Nutella. Each bite varies, but once in a while you&#8217;ll get one loaded with perfect chocolatey, nutty chunks. Then it becomes undeniable that this is indeed ice cream made with real Nutella and not some laughable knock-off. &#8220;The chunks seal the deal,&#8221; said one <em>TIME<\/em> staffer, who considers himself something of a Nutella aficionado. &#8220;Go chunky or go home.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Next, we tried the Nutella soft-serve, which is a lighter alternative if you&#8217;re not in the mood for the admittedly very heavy hand-scooped ice cream.
