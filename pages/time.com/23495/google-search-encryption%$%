<p>Google will introduce encrypted search results globally on a yet-unannounced release schedule. However, Google has already started encrypting searches of Chinese users in defiance of that country’s tight censorship regime, The Washington <i>Post</i> reports. The move represents a shot at Beijing in Google&#8217;s standoff with Chinese authorities over unmet demands that the company send Chinese users to government-approved sites. In 2010, Google moved its Chinese operation to semi-autonomous Hong Kong and now accounts for only five percent of China’s search market.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s steps to encrypt search results follow a decision to encrypt Internet traffic between its data centers after Edward Snowden, working with journalists Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald and others, revealed last year the extent of National Security Agency surveillance of web traffic in the U.S.</p>
<p>“The revelations of this past summer underscored our need to strengthen our networks. Among the many improvements we’ve made in recent months is to encrypt Google Search by default around the world,” a Google spokesperson told the <i>Post</i>. “This builds on our work over the past few years to increase the number of our services that are encrypted by default and encourage the industry to adopt stronger security standards.”</p>

Such offerings, which often include stand-alone vision and dental care, are becoming healthcare game changers in an increasingly complex marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) established healthcare exchanges, providing multiple new ways for companies to secure benefits. Today, companies can choose to use a public or private exchange\u2014or continue to purchase directly from an insurance provider\u2014based on their specific needs. That flexibility comes in handy for companies that, for example, want to streamline medical coverage through an exchange but are looking to fill in coverage gaps by purchasing benefits like vision directly.<\/p>\n<p>Whether companies choose to purchase through an exchange or directly, the important thing is to make sure your benefit package is complete. Doing so can offer some significant advantages for both companies and their employees. For example, companies are able to attract and retain employees with a <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/content-from\/vsp\/2818373\/mid-cycle-enrollments-a-breeze-for-companies\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:blue;\">rich benefits package<\/span><\/a>. At the same time, these ancillary benefits also offer hidden value. Many systemic conditions are detected first through vision and dental examinations. A 2013 study by Human Capital Management Services, Inc. (HCMS)<sup>1<\/sup> found that 62 percent of the time, doctors for vision-care provider VSP Vision Care detected signs of high cholesterol before other healthcare providers recorded the condition.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, VSP early detection rates were 34 percent for diabetes and 39 percent for hypertension. The study also showed that the patients identified through an eye exam entered the health care system with fewer complications and co-occurring illnesses, and experienced lower rates of inpatient admissions and emergency room visits. The study also verified that keeping these employees healthier reduced absenteeism and turnover while increasing productivity while at work.<\/p>\n<p>The HCMS study found that for every initial $1 spent by clients on exam services, they saved $1.45 in improved productivity and reduced healthcare costs over a four-year span. This translates to a 145 percent return on the initial dollar investment. The total savings of the six companies in the study over four years was $13.1 million.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise, then, that more and more companies have begun to add ancillary products to their benefits mix. In fact, since 2008 the number of companies offering such products has doubled.<\/p>\n<p>Not all ancillary plans are created equal, though. It\u2019s important to find a benefits partner that can deliver the products and services that companies and their employees care about most. For example, delivering on consumer priorities like low out of pocket costs and the ability to personalize their benefit help drive satisfaction and utilization, which in turn, helps employers attract and retain top performers \u2013 and keep them healthy and productive.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><sup>1<\/sup>Human Capital Management Services, 2013 Study of VSP Eye Health Management Program<\/p>","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/isp2004637_ofw.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/isp2004637_ofw.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/isp2004637_ofw.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/isp2004637_ofw.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/isp2004637_ofw.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"www.imagesource.com","caption":"","alt":"Businesspeople in a meeting"},"id":2914279,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Fvsp%2F2914279%2Fflexible-benefits-packages-serve-your-employees-best%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nyXp8Q","encoded_title":"Flexible+Benefits+Packages+Serve+Your+Employees+Best","twitter_text":"Flexible%20Benefits%20Packages%20Serve%20Your%20Employees%20Best","twitter_via":"TIME","sponsor":{"name":"VSP","slug":"vsp","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/vsplogowhclr_300dpi.png?w=38","color":"#9e9e9e"},"email_title":"Flexible%20Benefits%20Packages%20Serve%20Your%20Employees%20Best%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Flexible%20Benefits%20Packages%20Serve%20Your%20Employees%20Best%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcontent-from%2Fvsp%2F2914279%2Fflexible-benefits-packages-serve-your-employees-best%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner"}}],"single_article":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/23495\/google-search-encryption\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1gnqiFg","title":"Google Will Start Encrypting Your Searches","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Google Will Begin Encrypting Your Searches","excerpt":"The tech behemoth plans to make users' searches more private as part of the company's broader campaign to push back against hackers and government surveillance.

In 2010, Google moved its Chinese operation to semi-autonomous Hong Kong and now accounts for only five percent of China\u2019s search market.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s steps to encrypt search results follow a decision to encrypt Internet traffic between its data centers after Edward Snowden, working with journalists Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald and others, revealed last year the extent of National Security Agency surveillance of web traffic in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe revelations of this past summer underscored our need to strengthen our networks.

No One Knows<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>Eyal Yifrah, 19, Gilad Shaar, 16, and Naftali Fraenkel, a 16-year-old with dual Israeli-American citizenship, were abducted on June 12 while hitchhiking home from the Jewish seminaries where they were studying near the West Bank city of Hebron. The teens&#8217; bodies were found Monday evening after 18 days of intense searches.<\/p>\n<p>A Defense official said based on the investigation that the teens were shot soon after they were abducted. He spoke anonymously in line with protocol as the investigation is still ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>Hamas, which has kidnapped Israelis in the past, has praised the abduction of the teenagers but not taken responsibility for it.<\/p>\n<p>In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri warned Israel against any broad offensive against the group, saying it would &#8220;open the gates of hell&#8221; on Israel.<\/p>\n<p>Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon issued a statement Tuesday vowing to find those behind the killings. &#8220;We see Hamas responsible for the kidnappings and murders. We will continue to pursue the murderers of the teens and will not rest until we lay our hands on them,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The man killed Tuesday was the first casualty since the bodies were found.<\/p>\n<p>A military spokesman meanwhile said aircraft struck 34 targets across Gaza overnight after more than 20 rockets were fired into Israel since late Sunday from the Palestinian territory.<\/p>\n<p>In an operation codenamed &#8220;Brother&#8217;s Keeper,&#8221; Israel dispatched thousands of troops across the West Bank in search of the youths, closed roads in the Hebron area and arrested some 400 Hamas operatives throughout the territory.<\/p>\n<p>There is a national spirit of solidarity in Israel, a small country with an &#8220;all for one and one for all&#8221; mentality that stems from compulsory military service for Jewish citizens, and news of the teens&#8217; deaths prompted an outpouring of grief.<\/p>\n<p>Large crowds of Israelis went to the homes of the families in the central Israeli towns of Nof Ayalon and Elad, and the West Bank settlement of Talmon, to pay their respects, while supporters lit memorial candles and prayed.<\/p>\n<p>Large gatherings were also held in Tel Aviv&#8217;s central Rabin Square, and at the West Bank junction where the youths were abducted, with Israelis singing hymns and songs, praying and lighting candles shaped in the names of the youths or the Jewish Star of David.<\/p>\n<p>Thousands of Israelis have died in wars and militant attacks over the years, and Israel has grappled with the abduction of soldiers and civilians in the past. But the ages of the victims, and the fact that they were unarmed civilians, struck a raw nerve.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today is really a national mourning day in Israel,&#8221; said Eitan Schwartz, from the Tel Aviv municipality.<\/p>\n<p>Israel has said two well-known Hamas operatives from Hebron are the primary suspects. The men, Marwan Qawasmeh and Amer Abu Aisheh, have not been seen since the teens went missing, and military officials said the search for them would continue.<\/p>\n<p>Israeli soldiers blew up a door of Abu Aisheh&#8217;s home in Hebron early Tuesday, said an Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to protocol. AP photos show extensive damage to one side of the house.<\/p>\n<p>Netanyahu met with top security officials late into the night Monday to discuss how to respond, and officials are expected to resume deliberations on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>After a two-week crackdown on Hamas in the West Bank, few major targets remain there. Hamas had already been weakened by seven years of pressure by Israel and the forces of Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.<\/p>\n<p>Israel could turn its attention toward the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, where it has been battling a surge in rocket fire since the teens went missing.<\/p>\n<p>The intensified rocket attacks have lightly injured several Israelis, damaged houses and destroyed a factory. One rocket fired by the Palestinian militants exploded prematurely in Gaza last week, killing a Palestinian girl.<\/p>\n<p>Israel also might consider stronger political action. The crisis has escalated already heightened tensions between Israel and the new Palestinian government, which is headed by Abbas but backed by Hamas.<\/p>\n<p>Hamas, an offshoot of the region-wide Muslim Brotherhood, is deeply rooted in Palestinian society. The movement&#8217;s political goal is an Islamic state in all of historic Palestine, including the territory that now makes up Israel.<\/p>\n<p>Israel and its Western allies consider Hamas, which has killed hundreds of Israelis in suicide bombings and other attacks, a terrorist group.<\/p>\n<p>Netanyahu&#8217;s spokesman Mark Regev called on Abbas &#8220;to break his alliance with these killers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This atrocity, this murder of innocent teenagers on their way home from school, is a clear example. It demonstrates that Hamas has not changed. It remains a vicious, vile terrorist organization that targets every Israeli civilian man, woman and as we&#8217;ve seen, children as well,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The slain teens are to be laid to rest Tuesday afternoon.<\/p>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/"},"tag":{"name":"Israel","slug":"israel","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/israel\/"},"tags":"Benjamin

Their absence deprived parliament of a quorum.<\/p>\n<p>The entire session, from the opening national anthem to al-Hafidh&#8217;s final words, lasted less than two hours. The impasse prolongs what has already been days of intense jockeying as political blocs try to decide on the posts of prime minister, president and speaker of parliament.<\/p>\n<p>The country&#8217;s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, urged lawmakers last week to agree on the three posts before Tuesday&#8217;s meeting in hopes of averting months of wrangling that could further destabilize the country. But Tuesday&#8217;s session dashed the prospects \u2014 always farfetched \u2014 of a quick compromise.<\/p>\n<p>Embattled incumbent Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki \u2014 whose bloc won the most seats in April elections \u2014 is under intense pressure to step aside. Sunnis and Kurds accuse him of breaking promises, and long-held Sunni grievances are seen as one of the main factors driving resurgent militancy in the country.<\/p>\n<p>The need for a new government that can keep the country together is urgent following the recent offensive spearheaded by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, an al-Qaida breakaway group that has overrun much of northern and western Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>The threat posed to Iraq by the recent militant offensive was underlined by new casualty figures released Tuesday by the United Nations that put June&#8217;s death toll at 2,417 \u2014 making it the deadliest month so far this year.<\/p>\n<p>The figures issued by the U.N. mission to Iraq include 1,531 civilians and 886 security forces. UNAMI added that 2,287 Iraqis, including 1,763 civilians, were wounded.<\/p>\n<p>The figures exclude deaths in embattled Anbar province, which is largely controlled by Sunni militants.<\/p>\n<p>The second deadliest month this year was May, with 799 Iraqis killed, including 603 civilians.

Although the report indicated that minorities and households headed by single mothers were at the greatest risk of living in poverty, whites living in poor areas had the greatest proportional increase \u2014 from 11.3% in 2000 to 20.3% in 2008 to 2012.<\/p>\n<p>The report&#8217;s lead author, Alemayehu Bishaw of the Census Bureau&#8217;s Poverty Statistics Branch, said in a statement that federal and government agencies would be able to use the data to provide assistance to those in need. &#8220;Researchers have found that living in poor neighborhoods adds burdens to low-income families, such as poor housing conditions and fewer job opportunities,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the general rise throughout the country, the report found that the proportion of people living in poverty areas in West Virginia, Alaska, Louisiana, the District of Columbia and Hawaii actually decreased by at least 0.4 percentage points over the same period.<\/p>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/"},"tag":{"name":"poverty","slug":"poverty","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/poverty\/"},"tags":"American Community Survey|Impoverished|income|poverty|US Census Bureau","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/homelessness.jpg?crop=632px%2C111px%2C2703px%2C2703px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/homelessness.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/homelessness.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/homelessness.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/homelessness.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Jewel Samad\u2014AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"A man covers himself as he crosses a street under a snowfall in Washington, D.C. on March 25, 2014.","alt":"A man covers himself as he crosses a street under a snowfall in Washington, D.C. on March 25. 2014."},"id":2943653,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F2943653%2Fu-s-census-bureau-shows-more-people-living-in-areas-of-poverty%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1x8R4ba","encoded_title":"U.S.+Census+Bureau+Shows+More+People+Living+in+Areas+of+Poverty","twitter_text":"U.S.%20Census%20Bureau%20Shows%20More%20People%20Living%20in%20Areas%20of%20Poverty","twitter_via":"TIME","email_title":"U.S.%20Census%20Bureau%20Shows%20More%20People%20Living%20in%20Areas%20of%20Poverty%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"U.S.%20Census%20Bureau%20Shows%20More%20People%20Living%20in%20Areas%20of%20Poverty%0A%0AResearchers%20find%20living%20in%20poor%20neighborhoods%20adds%20burdens%20to%20low-income%20families%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F2943653%2Fu-s-census-bureau-shows-more-people-living-in-areas-of-poverty%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/2941689\/gm-recalls-2\/","right_now":true,"shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1k7bObb","title":"GM Recalls Another 7.6 Million Vehicles","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"GM Recalls Millions of Vehicles Amid Scandal","excerpt":"Six recalls announced on Monday greatly expand total number of recalled vehicles to over 25 million","format":"brief","time":{"pretty":"June 30, 2014","published":"2014-06-30 16:02:53","updated":"2014-06-30 20:02:53","minute":"4:02 pm","short":"6\/30"},"authors":[{"id":206966421,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/charlotte-alter\/","name":"Charlotte Alter","bio":"Charlotte Alter covers lifestyle, crime, and breaking news for TIME in New York City.

No One Knows<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>On Tuesday, up to 500,000 people are slated to march on the city\u2019s central financial district, in what in years past has encompassed myriad domestic grievances while commemorating the official end of British rule 17 years ago. This year\u2019s protest, however, forms the loudest testament yet to mounting opposition to just one thing: China.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have waited for democracy for so long, but year after year it\u2019s been bad news,\u201d 21-year-old Lee Kan-tat, a liberal student activist, said on Tuesday morning in Hong Kong\u2019s Victoria Park, where the march starts.<\/p>\n<p>The call of the day \u2014 and, for some political dissenters, of the past five years \u2014 is for &#8220;universal suffrage.&#8221; Beijing has agreed to enact electoral reforms, most importantly the direct election of Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive \u2014 the territory\u2019s highest office \u2014 by 2017, but only from a list of preapproved candidates who must be \u201cpatriotic.\u201d Nearly 800,000 Hong Kongers voted in an unofficial plebiscite that ended on Sunday and instead called for open nominations. Beijing deemed that referendum illegal.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe message from Hong Kong is very clear after the referendum,\u201d added Lee, \u201c800,000 people have spoken, and an overwhelming majority believe that the legislature should veto any reform proposal that doesn\u2019t meet international standards.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At present, there are 3.5 million registered voters in this Special Administrative Region, but virtually none of them have ever cast their ballot in the quinquennial elections for the Chief Executive. The position is instead appointed by a 1,200-seat election committee, whose decision ostensibly reflects both the wishes and interests of the people of Hong Kong.<\/p>\n<p>Critics of the system \u2014 and there are increasingly many \u2014 scoff at this presumption. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s hundred-plus-page de facto constitution, the majority of seats on the election committee are occupied by individuals hailing from Big Business and various professional sectors, with only a small fraction reserved for legislators directly represented by the people. Some point to this as a plainly and conspiratorially pro-China endeavor.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe government created a system that is deliberately complicated,\u201d says Emily Lau, the chairwoman of Hong Kong\u2019s Democratic Party, with marked bitterness. \u201cThe corporations don\u2019t want to upset Beijing \u2014 they need China to do business. So they elect pro-Chinese candidates. It\u2019s all \u2018money, money, money.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Within Hong Kong\u2019s ideologically popular but politically fragmented pro-democracy camp, Lau and her party represent the moderate minority that believes some tapered form of \u201cuniversal suffrage\u201d is compatible with the current electoral system structured by the Basic Law. In other words, the existence of the election committee needn\u2019t necessarily inhibit popular choice; what, Lau wondered aloud, if the latter had a role in determining the makeup of the former?<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t to say Lau and her fellow moderates have sympathy with the pro-Beijing side. Lau, whose seat in Hong Kong\u2019s legislature gives her an ex officio position on the election committee, has chosen to abstain from voting in past Chief Executive elections.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s pointless to take part,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you take part, you legitimize it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Given Beijing\u2019s trademark stubbornness when it comes to amending Hong Kong\u2019s constitution, Lau\u2019s moderate stance may encourage the most pragmatic course of action. Say what you will about the Chinese government in Hong Kong, but it\u2019s there to stay: Lau made a point to gesture outside her window to the 28-story headquarters of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, just across the road from her office in the Legislative Council Complex.<\/p>\n<p>But pragmatism doesn\u2019t always prevail, and reactionism tends to be radical. The past five years have seen the rise of pro-democracy student groups that view a complete upheaval of the current election system as the only option, and any who oppose such a solution as traitorous to the cause of building a democratic Hong Kong.<\/p>\n<p>For many of these activists, any gesture of political compromise with the Chinese government is a further sacrifice of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. A civil-disobedience movement called <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2919711\/hong-kong-democracy-occupy-central\/\">Occupy Central<\/a> threatens to paralyze the city\u2019s main business district later this month, naturally incurring Beijing\u2019s wrath. (Immediately after the July 1 march, a prominent students\u2019 group is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/article\/1543536\/students-plan-occupy-central-rehearsal-after-july-1-march\">planning<\/a> a rehearsal sit-in.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMore and more young people are aware of the disappointments and failures of the Chinese central government,\u201d says 22-year-old Johnson Yeung, convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organizes the July 1 protests. \u201cWe believe that civil disobedience is the best means of fighting for democracy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This sentiment of extremism has all but hijacked the pro-democracy stage in Hong Kong, with mixed results. While the \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d endorsed by Yeung and the thousands marching through downtown Hong Kong on Tuesday has given an unprecedented voice to the city\u2019s discontent with Chinese rule, it also threatens to intensify the political hostility coming from Beijing that prompted the discontent in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, China released a <a href=\"http:\/\/news.xinhuanet.com\/english\/china\/2014-06\/10\/c_133396891_11.htm\">white paper<\/a> condemning the intensified push for democracy in Hong Kong, calling the understanding of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy here \u201cconfused or lopsided,\u201d as by definition it only operates at the behest of Beijing. On Tuesday morning, a pro-democracy group <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hkchrislau\/status\/483762122438893568\" target=\"_blank\">burned<\/a> a copy of this document in protest.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe radical [pro-democracy] choice is loud, and potentially destabilizing,\u201d says David Zweig, a professor of social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. \u201cChina feels its sovereignty has been infringed upon. But it has all the authority it wants \u2014 there\u2019s nothing to stop it.

Of the 2,597 soldiers, 44% reported experiencing chronic pain that lasted for three months or more. 15% had taken opioids in the past month.<\/p>\n<p>By contrast, the study&#8217;s authors suggest that 26% of civilians endure chronic pain, whilst 4% take opioids. Robin Toblin, who led the study, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/science\/sciencenow\/la-sci-sn-soldiers-pain-opioids-20140630-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">told the Los Angeles <em>Times<\/em><\/a>: &#8220;We were surprised by the percentages.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Of the 1,131 soldiers who experienced chronic pain, nearly 14% described it as &#8220;severe&#8221;.

But experts said the study didn&#8217;t answer the questions it raised about whether opioids are being correctly prescribed.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;American medicine in general is overprescribing,&#8221; said Dr Mark Edlund, a psychiatrist and pain expert who was not involved with the survey.<\/p>\n<p>The study did suggest some soldiers might have been incorrectly prescribed opioids. Amongst those taking the drugs, 17 soldiers said they experienced no pain and 144 reported it as &#8220;mild&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Painkillers such as oxycodone and hydrocodone have faced a public backlash as addiction rates and fatal overdoses continue to increase. These drugs are considered most beneficial for short-term pain.

If you work at certain types of for-profit companies, they no longer have to cover the cost of any contraception that they say violates their religious beliefs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) requires most health insurance plans to cover birth control without cost-sharing. Without healthcare coverage, the pill can cost about $25 a month and an IUD (intrauterine device) can cost up to $900 (though it&#8217;s inserted once and lasts up to 12 years).<\/p>\n<p>Before the ruling, houses of worship were already exempt from the birth control insurance mandate. Non-profit organizations with religious affiliations, like Catholic colleges and hospitals have to inform the insurer if they object to contraceptives, and the insurer is then responsible for figuring out a way to guarantee contraceptive coverage for the workers without the company using its premiums to pay for it.<\/p>\n<p>The privately-owned corporation Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based craft store with self-described Christian values, argued that they too should not have to cover certain emergency contraception because of their religious beliefs. <span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">The company objected to paying for <\/span>emergency contraception included Plan B, Ella\u2014both commonly known as the morning after pill\u2014plus two types of IUDs. Hobby Lobby <span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">said they believe these types of birth control amount to abortion. <\/span><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">The company did not object to covering other types of contraception, including birth control pills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, but the ruling applies only to companies considered &#8220;closely held.&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/Help-&amp;-Resources\/Tools-&amp;-FAQs\/FAQs-for-Individuals\/Frequently-Asked-Tax-Questions-&amp;-Answers\/Small-Business,-Self-Employed,-Other-Business\/Entities\/Entities-5\">According to the IRS<\/a>, a company is &#8220;closely held&#8221; if five or fewer people own more than half the corporation. Closely held firms make up over <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/encyclopedia\/closely-held-corporations.html\" target=\"_blank\">90% of all American businesses<\/a>, and about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/the-fix\/wp\/2014\/06\/30\/a-lot-of-people-could-be-affected-by-the-supreme-courts-birth-control-decision\/\" target=\"_blank\">52% of the American workforce<\/a> works for a closely held corporation, according to studies from Columbia University and New York University. The Affordable Care Act, however, only requires employers with 50 or more employees to provide health insurance to workers, so many &#8220;closely held&#8221; firms are already exempt.<\/p>\n<p>Justice Samuel Alito suggested in his ruling that the Health and Human Services (HHS) department could extend the accommodations that they have in place for religious non-profits to these for-profit companies so the insurer would provide birth control without charging the company. However, both religious groups and women&#8217;s rights groups think this would be insufficient. Some religious non-profits have alleged that these accommodations still infringe on their religious beliefs and are suing the federal government. And advocates at the Women&#8217;s National Law Center <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vox.com\/2014\/6\/30\/5857634\/alito-gave-obama-some-advice-on-guaranteeing-contraceptive-coverage\" target=\"_blank\">have said<\/a> companies should be required to provide contraception as a basic healthcare need. The Obama administration may need to come up with a an alternative way to provide coverage, but it&#8217;s unclear what those options would be or how difficult they would be for consumers to access.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. All three female Justices dissented, arguing that this ruling limits women&#8217;s rights<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the dissenting opinion and was joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Stephen Breyer (the only male justice who dissented). &#8220;The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga would\u2026deny legions of women who do not hold their employers&#8217; beliefs access to contraceptive coverage,&#8221; Ginsberg wrote. &#8220;Religious organizations exist to foster the interests of persons subscribing to the same religious faith. Not so of for-profit corporations. Workers who sustain the operations of those corporations commonly are not drawn from one religious community,&#8221; she continued.<\/p>\n<p>Ginsberg notes that an IUD without coverage costs a month&#8217;s pay for minimum-wage workers. And critics of the ruling say that because a federal work around hasn&#8217;t been developed yet, many of the women who currently who work for places like Hobby Lobby have lost easy access to key family planning options and one of the most most effective type of birth control and even then, the fix may be cumbersome. And while some women are able to choose their place of employment taking health care into consideration, because of geography and economic restrictions, that&#8217;s not possible for all women.<\/p>\n<p>(Read the entire opinion and dissent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/opinions\/13pdf\/13-354_olp1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. The ruling may depress use of IUDs at some privately held corporations that deem it a form of  emergency contraception <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/the-best-form-of-birth-control-is-the-one-no-one-is-using\/\" target=\"_blank\">Health groups have begun to lobby for an increased use<\/a> of IUDs. The IUD has a failure rate of less than one pregnancy per 100 women in a year, better than both the pill (9 pregnancies per 100 women per year) and condoms (18 pregnancies per 100 women per year), <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/the-best-form-of-birth-control-is-the-one-no-one-is-using\/\" target=\"_blank\">according to the CDC<\/a>. Despite all these benefits, just 9% of women in America use it\u2014the lowest of any developed country. (By comparison, 23% of women in France and 41% of women in China use IUDs.) It&#8217;s just starting to gain traction in America: Planned Parenthood reports a 75% increase in use since 2008.<\/p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s decision, which gives certain companies the option of not covering the IUD, among other types of morning after contraception, arguably undermines gains made in IUD usage. The <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2800011\/whats-hobby-lobbys-problem-with-iuds\/\" target=\"_blank\">IUD can also be used as emergency contraception<\/a> if it is inserted five days after intercourse, hence the Hobby Lobby&#8217;s objection to it and not birth control pills. This isn&#8217;t the way most women use the IUD: many gynecologists will only schedule an appointment for IUD insertion until after a woman gets her period that month so as to insure she&#8217;s not pregnant. Some will even perform an ultrasound. There are no statistics on how many women use the IUD as an emergency contraceptive method instead of alternate methods like the &#8220;morning after&#8221; pills, but James Trussell, a Princeton Professor who has done extensive research on the topic, TIME&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2800011\/whats-hobby-lobbys-problem-with-iuds\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Begley<\/a>, &#8220;I would say that the number [of women] who get IUDs as emergency contraception is miniscule.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The fallout from today&#8217;s ruling could be that some women who work companies that refuse to cover the IUD may be discouraged from using this effective birth control method by additional costs they may incur or the complications of finding supplemental insurance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Women&#8217;s rights groups are angry because they see the ruling as a loss of autonomy for women<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some women&#8217;s rights advocates have taken the argument even further than Ginsburg did. Up until this point the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) has been interpreted as a protection for individuals&#8217; religious practices\u2014not those of corporations. The Supreme Court just said that these protections also extend to for-profit companies, but didn&#8217;t protect a woman&#8217;s right to choose her method of birth control. Thus, many critics argue, the Supreme Court decided that <a href=\"http:\/\/jezebel.com\/why-women-arent-people-but-corporations-are-1598061808\" target=\"_blank\">corporations are people, but women are not.<\/a> Women&#8217;s rights groups say restricting insurance coverage for some types of contraception, or making coverage more difficult to obtain, undermines access to birth control in general and point to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.upi.com\/Health_News\/2012\/10\/05\/Free-contraception-could-reduce-abortion-by-75-percent\/UPI-51581349469984\/\" target=\"_blank\">studies that have shown<\/a> that offering greater access to contraception\u2014rather than restricting it\u2014leads to fewer unintended pregnancies and thus reduces the number of abortions by 75 percent annually.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Under the ruling, some corporations could attempt to refuse coverage for other, non-contraceptive medications and procedures citing their religious beliefs <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As Ginsburg writes in her dissent, &#8220;Would the exemption\u2026extend to employers with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions (Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses); antidepressants (Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the majority opinion written by Justice Alito, he specifies that the ruling applies only to the contraceptive mandate, and states that it should not be understood to include to other insurance mandates, like those for blood transfusions or vaccinations. But Ginsburg notes that even if the Alito exclusion holds, there are other issues: &#8220;Approving some religious claims while deeming others unworthy of accommodation could be &#8216;perceived as favoring one religion over another,&#8217; the very risk the [Constitution's] Establishment Clause was designed to preclude,&#8221; said Ginsburg.<\/p>","section":{"name":"Living","slug":"living","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/living\/"},"tag":{"name":"politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/politics\/"},"tags":"Birth Control|contraception|politics|Supreme Court","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/451505850.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/451505850.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/451505850.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/451505850.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/451505850.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Bloomberg&mdash;Bloomberg via Getty Images","caption":"Activists who support the Affordable Care Act's employer contraceptive mandate demonstrate outside of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Monday, June 30, 2014.

While it\u2019s important to get up and moving when you can, standing for an entire day isn\u2019t good for you either.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health.com:<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/gallery\/0,,20655527,00.html?xid=Time-stand-062314\">15 Exercises for People in Pain<\/a><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what writer Dan Kois learned, according to a recent story for <em>New York<\/em> magazine. Kois tried standing 95% of the time for 30 days straight, and had cramps in his calves at bedtime and pain in his hips, heels, and legs\u2014even after using cushioned insoles and standing on an anti-fatigue mat at work. The take-home message? The goal isn\u2019t to make a complete switch from one to the other. As one University of Pittsburgh professor told Kois, jobs that require a lot of standing (like nursing or retail) are linked to their own set of health problems including varicose veins, lower-back pain, and increased risk of stroke.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes down to it, you really need both to stay healthy. There are easy ways to incorporate standing into your daily routine for better health.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips to break out of a mostly sedentary lifestyle:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Set an alarm<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It seems silly, but you need to remind yourself to get up. Setting your phone alarm or using an app like BreakTime for Mac devices are simple ways to encourage more movement throughout the day. Even the scientists that Kois talked to for his article used this strategy to stand up for 10 minutes every hour. Plus, you won\u2019t be able to ignore that loud ping on your smartphone or computer when the time comes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health.com:<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/gallery\/0,,20725746,00.html?xid=Time-stand-062314\">18 Moves to Tone Your Legs and Butt<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Start pacing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One activity you can certainly do while standing: talking on the phone. This is especially great for office dwellers who constantly get bogged down by calls or people who have lots of phone dates with friends and family. At work, you just need a long phone-to-ear cord or quality headset to ensure you get more mobile. Even taking a call standing will help your legs shift more naturally.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Walk whenever possible<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019d be surprised how many ways you can sneak walking into your daily routine. A quick walk after a meal can be a relaxing way to get your feet moving. After eating, the fat levels in your bloodstream are at their peak, so simply moving around post meal increases the activity of lipoprotein lipase, a gene that boosts your metabolism.<\/p>\n<p>If you drive to work, park your car a few blocks away from the building, suggests Roshini Raj, M.D., <em>Health<\/em>\u2018s contributing medical editor. That way you can get your legs working before you even get through the door. Same goes for you train and subway riders. Get off a stop or two early, or take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator to add some extra steps to your day. Dr. Raj also recommends walking to get your lunch instead of ordering in. It\u2019s that simple!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health.com<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/gallery\/0,,20432121,00.html?xid=Time-stand-062314\">10 Ways to Walk Off Fat Faster<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Choose the right seat<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The next time you go out for food or drinks, skip the table and try sitting at the bar. Seating yourself on the front third of a bar stool can help you maintain the S-shape in your spine and distribute your weight more evenly (that is, more weight supported by your feet and less by your butt). To mimic this position, called \u201cperching,\u201d spread your feet just wider than hip distance and gently roll your hips forward, arching your back slightly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ditch the chair<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Summer is definitely the time for concerts, tailgates, and lazy days at the park. Next time, don\u2019t haul a chair with you. Leaving your folding chairs at home will force you to get up more often while outdoors. Just have a blanket on hand to rest every so often, but don\u2019t be afraid to stand the whole time either\u2013better yet, go for a short walk while you\u2019re up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health.com:<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/gallery\/0,,20392437,00.html?xid=Time-stand-062314\">17 Easy Ways to Burn Calories Outdoors<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do stuff in person<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the best way to ask a question is face to face. Yes, it\u2019s super easy to email, call, or IM someone at work. But does walking to your coworker\u2019s desk really take that long? You may even get a faster response to a simple question this way. When it comes time to hash out a project, opt to chat with your colleague in person or even suggest taking a walk to the coffee machine. Both are great ways to get you two moving and working at the same time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Create mini workstations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The idea here is to give your body the chance to rotate between different positions throughout the day. Start by creating an area at your desk where you can stand and work. A box or milk crate covered with fabric can be a great resting place for your laptop, or you can leave memos to read on a shelf at standing height. If you\u2019re daring enough, you could even try a standing desk.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/news.health.com\/2014\/06\/19\/want-to-sit-less-heres-what-not-to-do\/?xid=Time-stand-062314\">This article originally appeared on Health.com.<\/a><\/p>","section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/health\/"},"tag":{"name":"fitness","slug":"fitness","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/fitness\/"},"tags":"fitness|Sitting|standing","id":2933498,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F2933498%2Fsit-less-standing%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1jrIHiK","encoded_title":"7+New+Ways+to+Sit+Less","twitter_text":"Want%20to%20sit%20less%3F%20Here%27s%20what%20not%20to%20do","twitter_via":"TIMEHealth","email_title":"7%20New%20Ways%20to%20Sit%20Less%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"7%20New%20Ways%20to%20Sit%20Less%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F2933498%2Fsit-less-standing%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-mag"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/2944935\/morning-must-reads-july-1\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1vrrSdf","title":"Morning Must Reads: July 1","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Morning Must Reads: July 1","excerpt":"In the News: Hobby Lobby happened, what's next; Obama to issue executive action on immigration; GM issues another recall; Israel bombs Gaza after teen bodies found; and confidence in Obama falls.

The film, which was directed by Craig Johnson and written by Johnson and Mark Heyman, even won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Skeleton Twins<\/em> will hit theaters across the U.S. on September 19.<\/p>\n","section":{"name":"Entertainment","slug":"entertainment","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/entertainment\/"},"tag":{"name":"movies","slug":"movies","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/movies\/"},"tags":"Bill Hader|Kristen Wiig|movies|SNL reunion|The Skeleton Twins","id":2944514,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F2944514%2Fskeleton-twins-trailer-kristen-wiig%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nYNA4b","encoded_title":"Watch+Kristen+Wiig+and+Bill+Hader+in+The+Skeleton+Twins+Trailer","video":{"title":"Watch Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader in <i>The Skeleton Twins<\/i> Trailer","embed":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/nhULZJDXLaE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'><\/iframe><\/div>","align":null},"twitter_text":"Watch%20Kristen%20Wiig%20and%20Bill%20Hader%20in%20The%20Skeleton%20Twins%20Trailer","twitter_via":"TIMECulture","email_title":"Watch%20Kristen%20Wiig%20and%20Bill%20Hader%20in%20The%20Skeleton%20Twins%20Trailer%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Watch%20Kristen%20Wiig%20and%20Bill%20Hader%20in%20The%20Skeleton%20Twins%20Trailer%0A%0AThe%20two%20%22Saturday%20Night%20Live%22%20alums%20reunite%20as%20depressed%20twins%20in%20the%20upcoming%20dramedy%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F2944514%2Fskeleton-twins-trailer-kristen-wiig%2F","icon":"video"},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/2944421\/france-burqa-niqab-ban-islam\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1qtPvE5","title":"France Can Keep Burqa Ban, European Court Rules","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"France Can Keep Burqa Ban, European Court Rules","excerpt":"Europe's top rights court has said a ban on wearing Islamic veils doesn't breach any rights","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"7:32 AM ET","published":"2014-07-01 07:32:08","updated":"2014-07-01 11:32:08","minute":"7:32 am","short":"7:32 AM ET"},"authors":[{"id":239589911,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/mirren-gidda\/","name":"Mirren Gidda","bio":"","twitter":"","twitter_url":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":null}],"content":"<p>Europe&#8217;s main human rights court ruled Tuesday that France&#8217;s ban on wearing a full-face veil is permissible, <a href=\"http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2014\/07\/01\/world\/europe\/france-burqa-ban\/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fedition_europe+(RSS%3A+Europe)\" target=\"_blank\">reports<\/a> CNN.<\/p>\n<p>The European Court of Human Rights said the French ban of garments worn by some Muslim women\u2014the burqa, a garment that envelops the body with a mesh over the face, and the niqab, a veil that covers the face\u2014didn&#8217;t breach the European Convention of Human Rights.<\/p>\n<p>A 24-year-old French woman took the case to the court in November because she felt the law restricted her ability to live according to her religion, culture and personal beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>France&#8217;s ban of the burqa and the niqab went into effect in April 2011. The law has sparked fierce debate between believers of religious freedom and those who think the veil is both restrictive and contravenes France&#8217;s secularism.<\/p>\n<p>The woman, who hasn&#8217;t been named, drew upon several articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which the court was set up to protect. The defendant cited the right to private and family life as well as freedoms of thought, conscience and religion.<\/p>\n<p>She added that no one has required her to wear the burqa and the niqab, nor does she wear them all the time. France charges a fine of 150 euros or $205 for anyone wearing the garments.
