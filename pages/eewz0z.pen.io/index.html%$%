</p>
<p>The last four months of my life have been spent in the pursuit of getting to know myself better.  It all started about seven months ago when I was working at a job I didn't hate but I wasn't happy at.  I couldn't put my finger on exactly <em>why</em> I felt the way I did so when a friend came to me with a job that offered twice what I was making and  the opportunity to work on open source software I jumped at the chance.  This is what I learned:</p><p><em>I am a bad software developer.</em></p><p>I walked away from that awesome gig after three months.  It was a contract-to-hire situation and I got wind of some sort of internal political struggle at the company that I wasn't invested in battling.  I wasn't any happier and I still wasn't unhappy.  I just didn't find anything particularly challenging or interesting anymore.  So I decided to take some time off and get it together.</p><p>I planned my sabbatical carefully so as to not risk my family's financial outlook.  I had paid off my debts and had enough money to take 4-5 months off of work.  I created the cash-flow spreadsheet, budget, and came up with a plan to take two months off completely, one month to interview, and the fourth month would be a buffer in case interviewing would take longer than I had anticipated.</p><p>I am now in the buffer zone and have interviewed with close to ten companies to date.  I have not been offered a single job and have not made it past the technical interview in most cases.  I am a programmer.  Until recently I had believed I was a good programmer.  However in an industry where hiring practices have adjusted to filter out the plethora of bad, unqualified candidates I've found it rather difficult to consider myself a good programmer any longer.</p><p>When I started expressing my anxieties to my friends and colleagues (most of whom I consider more experienced and intelligent than myself) they assured me that I was reducing the problem to terms that were far too simple to express the complicated reality I found myself in.  These are people who have personally reviewed my code, hired me for previous jobs, and have a good idea of what it was like working with me.  They had nothing bad to say about my work history, the quality of my work, or my skills as a programmer.  I wasn't a bad developer, they would say, I was perhaps just bad at interviews.</p><p>If I was only faced with a handful of rejections I might have believed them.  However I have received nothing but rejections so far.  And only twice have I made it past the first technical interview.  If I had at least one or two offers I might believe them but can the system be so wrong as to <em>consistently</em> overlook a good developer even if they are bad at interviews?  Conversely isn't it possible that the system does work well and I am a bad developer being kept from taking good jobs away from qualified candidates?</p><p>For the record I'm not one of those people who complains that they're not good at something and does nothing about it.  I practice code-kata every day before I get down to work.  I have a few solutions to some problems on Rosetta Code in exotic languages just for fun.  I contribute to open source software regularly.  And I've even tried practicing speaking to people and learning how to sell myself better in conversation.  The latter I find most challenging as I find it rather difficult to relate to people until I've been around them for a while.  The moral of the story here is that you don't get anywhere unless you try.</p><p>The problem is that I'm not getting anywhere and it's wearing me down.  This is the last month that I can afford to pay the rent and bills without going back into debt and I still don't have any offers on the table.  I wanted to move my family out of this rented apartment in an aging condo and into a house with a yard.  But it seems like I won't be able to work in this industry again.  And I'm afraid that I don't know how to do anything else.</p><p>So what does a bad developer look like?</p><p>Well my bookshelf is stocked with the classics: <em>SICP</em>, <em>On Lisp</em>, <em>TAOCP</em>, <em>Expert C Programming</em>, <em>Effective C++</em>, and textbooks on algorithms, distributed computing, security, graphics, and maths of various branches.  I've read most of them (I'm still digesting <em>TAOCP</em> a chunk at a time).  I also frequently read papers and magazines from the likes of the ACM, IEEE, and various PhD's.  If you were to judge me just by my reading list you'd think I was university-trained but I'm not.  I just like programming and want to know everything that I can.</p><p>I contribute to a plethora of open source projects in a range of languages such as C++, Perl, Python, and even various Lisp-like languages.  Some of these projects are bits of software that I've used that don't have the functionality I required, were new projects that needed developers to fix bugs or add missing features, or were otherwise ideas for libraries or applications I've found myself needing.</p><p>I'm concerned with improving my craft.  As I mentioned previously I practice code-kata.  At many organizations I've worked at I championed automated testing.  I read plenty of books, papers, and articles.  I write and try to teach others what I know.</p><p>I enjoy mathematics.  After reading all that I could about information theory after coming across Shannon Entropy I started delving into Order theory.  I really like joint semi-lattices, sets, relational algebra, sentential databases.  I don't remember the particulars but I know that for every recursive form there is an iterative solution.  If I need to know I have my journals and text books.</p><p>And for all of this I still blunder my way through an exercise to write a function which returns a boolean in response to the question of whether sequence <em>A</em> is a sub-sequence of sequence <em>B</em>.  I still draw a blank when asked what the magnitude of complexity is for the <em>guests</em> function I just wrote (damnit, of course calculating the permutations of a list is n-squared, but this is an interrogation of the random trivia I can manage to recall and I feel like a deer in the headlights).  Any shred of confidence I had has been beaten out of me with every mistake, blunder, and rejection.</p><p>At the end of my journey I find that I am depressed, desperate, and fear that I will let my family down.  My daughter is going to ask me what I do for a living some day and I will have to bite my lip and tell her that I program computers.  And I will have to dodge her probing questions as she gets older and avoid telling her that I do whatever I can to put food on the table.  I never achieved much and there's nothing I have done that I'm especially proud of.  I just got by as best I could even when the world decided I wasn't good enough anymore.</p><p>I am a bad software developer and this is my life.</p></div>
