        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What struck me was the incredible power that is developing in bioinformatics and genomics, which so resembles the evolution in computer software and hardware over the past 30 years. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George Church's discussion of the acceleration of the Moore's law doubling time for genetic sequencing rates,, for example, was extraordinary, from 1.5 efoldings to close to 10 efoldings per year.  When both George and Craig independently described their versions of the structure of the minimal genome appropriate for biological functioning and reproduction, I came away with the certainty that artificial lifeforms will be created within the next few years, and that they offered great hope for biologically induced solutions to physical problems, like potentially buildup of greenhouse gases. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, I came away feeling that the biological threats that come with this emerging knowledge and power are far greater than I had previously imagined, and this issue should be seriously addressed, to the extent it is possible.  But ultimately I also came away with a more sober realization of the incredible complexity of the systems being manipulated, and how far we are from actually developing any sort of comprehensive understanding of the fundamental molecular basis of complex life. The simple animation demonstrated at the molecular level for Gene expression and replication demonstrated that the knowledge necessary to fully understand and reproduce biochemical activity in cells is daunting. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two other comments: (1) was intrigued by the fact that the human genome has not been fully sequenced, in spite of the hype, and (2) was amazed at the available phase space for new discovery, especially in forms of microbial life on this planet, as demonstrated by Craig in his voyage around the world, skimming the surface, literally, of the ocean, and of course elsewhere in the universe, as alluded to by George. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, I also began to think that structures on larger than molecular levels may be the key ones to understand for such things as memory, which make the possibilities for copying biological systems seem less like science fiction to me.  George Church and I had an interesting discussion about this which piqued my interest, and I intend to follow this up.</font></p>

Church didn't mention phlogiston, but it's what came to mind as a good analogy. Heat is not the presence or absence of some substance or quality, but rather a measurable characteristic of a complex thermodynamic system. Might not the same be true of life? ...</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>14. August 2009 &mdash; </em>John Brockman is a New York City literary agent with a twist: not only does he represent many of the world's top scientists and science writers, he's also founder and head of the Edge Foundation (www.edge.org), devoted to disseminating news of the latest advances in cutting-edge science and technology.  Over the weekend of 24-26 July, in Los Angeles, Brockman's foundation sponsored a &quot;master class&quot; in which two of these same scientists  &mdash; George Church, a molecular geneticist at Harvard Medical School, and Craig Venter, who helped sequence the human genome  &mdash; gave a set of lectures on the subject of synthetic genomics.  The event, which was by invitation only, was attended by about twenty members of America's technological elite, including Larry Page, co-founder of Google; Nathan Myhrvold, formerly chief technology officer at Microsoft; and Elon Musk, founder of PayPal and head of SpaceX, a private rocket manufacturing and space exploration firm which is housed in a massive hangar-like structure near Los Angeles International Airport.  The first day's session, in fact, was held on the premises of  SpaceX, where the Tesla electric car is also built. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Synthetic genomics, the subject of the conference, is the process of replacing all or part of an organism's natural DNA with synthetic DNA designed by humans.  It is essentially genetic engineering on a mass scale.  As the participants were to learn over the next two days, synthetic genomics will make possible a variety of miracles, such as bacteria reprogrammed to turn coal into methane gas and other microbes programmed to churn out jet fuel.  Still other genomic engineering techniques will allow scientists to resurrect a range of extinct creatures including the woolly mammoth and, just maybe, even Neanderthal man. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The specter of &quot;biohackers&quot; creating new infectious agents made its obligatory appearance, but synthetic genomic researchers are, almost of necessity, optimists.  George Church, one of whose special topics was &quot;Engineering Humans 2.0,&quot; told the group that &quot;DNA is excellent programmable matter.&quot;  Just as automated sequencing machines can read the natural order of a DNA molecule, automated DNA synthesizing machines can create stretches of deliberately engineered DNA that can then be placed inside a cell so as to modify its normal behavior.  Many bacterial cells, for example, are naturally attracted to cancerous tumors.  And so by means of correctly altering their genomes it is possible to make a species of cancer-killing bacteria, organisms that attack the tumor by invading its cancerous cells, and then, while still inside them, synthesizing and then releasing cancer-killing toxins. <br />
              <br />
              Church and his Harvard lab team have already programmed bacteria to perform each of these functions separately, but they have not yet connected them all together into a complete and organized system.  Still, &quot;we're getting to the point where we can program these cells almost as if they were computers,&quot; he said.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But tumor-killing microbes were only a small portion of the myriad wonders described by Church.  Another was the prospect of &quot;humanized&quot; or  &mdash; even &quot;personalized&quot;  &mdash; mice.  These are mammals whose genomes are injected with bits of human DNA for the purpose of getting the animals to produce disease-fighting antibodies that would not be rejected by humans.  A personalized mouse, whose genome was modified with some of your very own genetic material, would produce antibodies that would not be rejected by your own body. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Beyond that is the possibility of creating synthetic organisms that would be resistant to a whole class of natural viruses.  There are two ways of doing this, one of which involves creating DNA that is a mirror-image of natural DNA.  Like many biological and chemical substances, DNA has a chirality or handedness, the property of existing in either left-handed or right-handed structural forms.  In their natural state, most biological molecules including DNA and viruses are left-handed.  But by artificially constructing right-handed DNA, it would be possible to make synthetic living organisms whose DNA is a mirror-image of the original.  They would be resistant to conventional enzymes, parasites, and predators because their DNA would not be recognized by the mirror-image version.  Such synthetic organisms would constitute a whole new &quot;mirror-world&quot; of living things. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Church is also founder and head of the Personal Genome Project, or PGP.  The project's purpose, he said, is to sequence the genomes of 100,000 volunteers with the goal of opening up a new era of personalized medicine.  Instead of today's standardized, one-size-fits-all collection of pills and therapies, the medicine of the future will be genomically tailored to each individual patient, and its treatments will fit him or her as well as a made-to-order suit of clothes.  Church also speculated that knowledge of the idiosyncratic features that lurk deep within each of our genomes  &mdash; genetic differences that give rise to every person's respective set of individuating traits  &mdash; will bring us an unprecedented level of self-understanding, and, therefore, will allow us to chart a more intelligent and informed course through life. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Toward the end of the first day Elon Musk, for whom the word charismatic could have well been coined, described a genomic transformation of another type.  While a video of his Falcon 1 rocket being launched from the Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific played in the background, Musk spoke about sending the human species to the planets.  That might have seemed an unrealistic goal were it not for the fact that on 13 July, just twelve days prior to the Edge event, SpaceX had successfully launched another Falcon 1 rocket that had placed Malaysia's RazakSAT into Earth orbit.  Earlier, competing against both Boeing and Lockheed, SpaceX had won NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition to resupply cargo to the International Space Station. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then, like an emperor leading his subjects, Musk gave the conference attendees a tour of his spacecraft manufacturing facility.  We saw the rocket engine assembly area, several launch vehicle components under construction, the mission operations area, and an example of the company's Dragon spacecraft, a pressurized capsule for the transport of cargo or passengers to the ISS. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is all geared to extending life beyond earth to a multiplanet civilization,&quot; Musk said of the spacecraft.  Suddenly, his particular version of the future was no longer so unbelievable. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The leadoff speaker on the second and last day of the conference was J. Craig Venter, the human genome pioneer who more recently cofounded Synthetic Genomics Inc., an organization devoted to commercializing genomic engineering technologies.  One of the challenges of synthetic genomics was to pare down organisms to the minimal set of genes needed to support life.  Venter called this &quot;reductionist biology,&quot; and said that a fundamental question was whether it would be possible to reconstruct life by putting together a collection of its smallest components. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brewer's yeast, Venter discovered, could assemble fragments of DNA into functional chromosomes.  He described a set of experiments in which he and colleagues created 25 small synthetic pieces of DNA, injected them into a yeast cell, which then proceeded to assemble the pieces into a chromosome.  The trick was to design the DNA segments in such a way that the organism puts them together in the correct order.  It was easy to manipulate genes in yeast, Venter found.  He could insert genes, remove genes, and create a new species with new characteristics.  In August 2007, he actually changed one species into another.  He took a chromosome from one cell and put it into different one.  &quot;Changing the software [the DNA] completely eliminated the old organism and created a new one,&quot; Venter said. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Separately, Venter and his group had also created a synthetic DNA copy of the phiX virus, a small microbe that was not infectious to humans.  When they put the synthetic DNA into an E. coli bacterium, the cell made the necessary proteins and assembled them into the actual virus, which in turn killed the cell that made it.  All of this happened automatically in the cell, Venter said: &quot;The software builds its own hardware.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These and other genomic creations, transformations, and destructions gave rise to questions about safety, the canonical nightmare being genomically engineered bacteria escaping from the lab and wreaking havoc upon human, animal, and plant.  But a possible defense against this, Venter said, was to provide the organism with &quot;suicide genes,&quot; meaning that you create within them a chemical dependency so that they cannot survive outside the lab.  Equipped with such a dependency, synthetic organisms would pose no threat to natural organisms or to the biosphere.  Outside the lab they would simply die. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That would be good news if it were true, because with funding provided by ExxonMobil, Venter and his team are now building a three to five square-mile algae farm in which reprogrammed algae will produce biofuels. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Making algae make oil is not hard,&quot; Venter said.  &quot;It's the scalability that's the problem.&quot;  Algae farms of the size required for organisms to become efficient and realistic sources of energy are expensive.  Still, algae has the advantage that it uses CO2 as a carbon source  &mdash; it actually consumes and metabolizes a greenhouse gas  &mdash; and uses sunlight as an energy source.  So what we have here, potentially, are living solar cells that eat carbon dioxide as they produce new hydrocarbons for fuel. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George Church had the final say in a lecture entitled &quot;Engineering Humans 2.0.&quot;  Human beings, he noted, are limited by a variety of things: by their ability to concentrate and remember, by the shortness of their lifespans, and so on.  Genomic engineering could be used to correct all these deficiencies and more.  The common laboratory mouse, he noted, had an average lifespan of 2.5 years.  The naked mole rate, by contrast, lives ten times longer, to the ripe old age of 25.   It would be possible to find the genes that contributed to the longevity of the naked mole rat, and by importing those genes into the lab mouse, you could slowly increase its longevity. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An analogous process could also be tried on human beings, increasing their lifespans and adding to their memory capacity, but the question was whether it was wise to do this.  There were always trade-offs, Church said.  You may engineer humans to have bigger and stronger bones, but only at the price if making them heavier and more ungainly.  Malaria resistance is coupled with increased susceptibility to sickle cell anemia.  And so on down the list.  In a conference characterized by an excess of excess, Church provided a welcome cautionary note.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But then he proceeded to pull out all the stops an argued that by targeted genetic manipulation of the elephant genome it might be possible to resurrect the woolly mammoth.  And by doing the same to the chimpanzee genome, scientists could possibly resurrect Neanderthal man. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Why would anyone want to resurrect Neanderthal man?&quot; a conference participant asked. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;To create a sibling species that would give us a fresh outlook on ourselves,&quot; Church answered.  Humans were a monoculture, he said, and monocultures were biologically at risk. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His answer did not satisfy all of those present.  &quot;We already have enough Neanderthals in Washington,&quot; Craig Venter quipped, thereby effectively bringing the Edge Master Class 2009 to a close. </font><br />

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Genetic engineering is now at a point where  computer science was around the mid-eighties. The early PCs were limited as to purpose and network. In two and a half decades, the computer has led us into a digial world in which every aspect of lives has been affected. According to Moore's Law,  the performance of computers doubles every 18 months. Genetic engineering is following a similar growth. On the last weekend in July, Craig Venter and George Church met in Los Angeles to lead a seminar on synthetic genetic engineering for John Brockman's science forum Edge.org. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Genetic engineering under Church has been following the grwoth of  computer science growing by a factor of tenfold per year. After all, the cost of sequencing a genome dropped from three billion dollars in 2000 to around $50 000 dollars as Stanford University's Dr. Steven Quake genomics engineer announced this week. 17 commercial companies a;ready offer similar services. In June, a &quot;Consumer Genetics&quot; exhibition was held in Boston for the first time. The Vice President of Knome, Ari Kiirikki, assumes that the cost of sequencing a genome in the next ten years will fall to less than $1,000. In support for this development, the X-Prize Foundation has put up a prize of ten million dollars for the sequencing of 100 full genomes within ten days for the cost of less than $10,000 dollars per genome sequenced. <br />
          <br />
          It is now up to the companies themselves to provide  an ethical and legal standing to commercial genetic engineering. The States of New York and California have already made the sale of genetic tests subject to a prescription. This is however only a  first step is to adjust a new a new commercialized science which is about to cause  enormous changes similar to those brought about be computer science. Medical benefits are likely to be enormous. Who knows about dangers in its genetic make-up, can preventive measures meet. The potential for abuse is however likewise given. Health insurances and employers could discriminate against with the DNS information humans. Above all however our self-understanding will change. Which could change, if synthetic genetic engineering becomes a mass market, is not yet foreseeable. For example, Craig Venter is working on synthetic  biofuels. If successful, such a development would re-align technology, economics and politics in a fundamental way. Of one thing we can already be certain. The question of whether genetic engineering will becomes available for all is no longer on the table. It has already happened.</font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Von aktuellen Entwicklungen aus der sch&ouml;nen neuen Welt der Genom-Sequenzierung berichtet Andrian Kreye: &quot;Am letzten Juliwochenende trafen sich Craig Venter und George Church in Los Angeles, um f&uuml;r John Brockmans Wissenschaftsforum <a href="/">Edge.org</a> ein Seminar &uuml;ber synthetische Gentechnik zu leiten. Die Gentechnik, so Church, habe die Informatik dabei l&auml;ngst hinter sich gelassen und entwickle sich mit einem Faktor von zehn pro Jahr. Immerhin - der Preis f&uuml;r die Sequenzierung eines Genoms ist von drei Milliarden Dollar im Jahr 2000 auf rund 50.000 Dollar gefallen, wie der Ingenieur der Stanford University Dr. Steven Quake diese Woche bekanntgab. 17 kommerzielle Firmen bieten ihre Dienste schon an.&quot;</font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a growing consensus (at least in Silicon Valley) that the information age is about to give way to the era of synthetic genetics. That was underscored recently when Harvard geneticist George Church and J. Craig Venter &mdash; of the race to decode the human genome fame &mdash; gave lectures before a small group of scientists, technologists, entrepreneurs, and writers in West Hollywood.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The event, billed as &quot;A Short Course on Synthetic Genetics&quot;, was organized by John Brockman, the literary impresario (and book agent for several New York Times reporters, including this one) who publishes the cybersalon-style website <a href="/">www.edge.org</a>, a forum dedicated to scientists (many of whom are his clients) and their ideas.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In roughly <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/church_venter09/church_venter09_index.html">six hours of lectures</a> both scientists tried to convey how the world will be changed by the ability to routinely read genetic sequences into computing systems and then store, replicate, alter and insert them back into living cells.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rate at which this technology is now improving puts silicon to shame. Dr. Church noted that between 1970 and 2005 gene sequencing had taken place on a Moore&rsquo;s Law pace, improving at about 1.5 times per year. Since then it has improved at the rate of an order of magnitude, or ten times annually.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the process the cost of sequencing the human genome has plunged from $3 billion to $5 thousand and continues to fall. Dr. Church identified 17 companies and one &quot;open source&quot; project all pursuing different technologies to further push down cost and speed up the pace of sequencing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a consequence, the structure of the emerging synthetic genetics industry is beginning to mirror that of the semiconductor and computer industries, which are based on modular components and design tools.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The key to the vast growth of the computer industry took place during the 1970s when physicist Carver Mead helped give the industry a standard design approach based on modular components. Now that appears to be happening in the synthetic biology world as well.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For someone who has spent the past three decades writing about computing, Dr. Venter&rsquo;s talk was eye-opening.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I view DNA as an analog information system,&quot; he said. &quot; and I hope to convince you in fact that it is absolutely the software of life.&quot; </font></p>
