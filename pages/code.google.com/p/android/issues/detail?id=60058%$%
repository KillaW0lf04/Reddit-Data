In Android 4.2.2 I have seen an abnormal cpu usage being consumed by mm-qcamera-daemon.

Test Scenario:

1) Open Camera
2) Attach to SurfaceHolder
3) Watch CPU usage in top

It fluctuates between 0 and 50% + on a Nexus 7 (2013)

This seems very odd since the camera service isn't doing all that much.

I have the same issue on my Nexus 5 running 4.4.2.  mm-qcamera-daemon seems to start for some reason and drains the battery.  If the phone's plugged in when this is happening then the battery doesn't charge and the phone gets very warm.  

Like others have said, restarting fixes it temporarily until around 1-3 days later when it happens again.

Same issue, Nexus5 bought directly to Google (Spain). Perhaps related, but sometimes camera does not work with a message like &quot;unable to connect to camera&quot;. This bug is a pain, it drains cpu really quickly. Thanks in advance.

ONE OTHER OBSERVATION: I haven't seen anyone mention this, so I thought I'd throw this in. The &quot;eye&quot; icon in my notification bar was on the entire time the phone was warm, even though I had turned off all the &quot;smart&quot; stay/pause/etc. Could it be related to these apps using the camera to watch? I didn't have the yahoo chat plugin or any of the other apps I have seen mentioned in this forum and others.

Observed on first day of using Note 3 out of the box.

The issue occurs on the Google Nexus 5, and it doesn't have any of the TouchWiz software.

Here's what I have noticed over the past couple weeks.

my phone: Nexus 5, 32GB, Black - unlocked bootloader, stock 4.4.2, rooted
wife's phone: Nexus 5, 32GB, White - locked bootloader, stock 4.4.2

My phone has never had this issue.  I never see the process running and it has never drained my battery.

Wife's phone has had the process considerably and quickly drain her battery down from full charge to 50% or less in a matter of hours. This has happened 5 or 6 times since she first noticed it a few weeks ago.  In most cases a reboot solves the problem and it stays that way for a few days.  Also, her camera seems to freeze up and crash on her periodically. Mine never does, and we both take a lot of pictures.  Not sure if the camera crashing is a symptom, or a cause of the mm-qcamera-daemon process that is chewing up the battery. 

I'm gathering a list of the apps installed on both phones and will look for any commonality or obvious differences between our 2 phones.  In particular anything that might use the camera in some way.

AT&amp;T Samsung Note 3 - stock rom

Started noticing this issue a couple days ago. The battery usage for mm-qcamera-daemon is lingering around 60% which is extremely high. I'm uninstalling instagram like others have suggested and removing the camera icon from the homescreen. I will update you guys if indeed this solution works.

I am pretty positive SnapChat is one of the culprits behind this - the app crashes my camera (message &quot;Cannot connect to camera&quot;), then mm-qcamera-daemon starts going haywire, resulting in a hot phone and lots of battery drain.

Having been unable to identify the root cause of this issue I finally did a factory reset of my Nexus 5 several days ago. Despite the inconvenience, this seems to have solved the issue.

Im also having this issue on my nexus 5... i tried all above, rebooting, removing camera from home screen and un-installing a few apps i thought wouldve been the culprit. But it still appears on my battery stats and consumes about 40% of my phone... still cant think of what else this may be. Is this a stock issue or an app issue?

Another one with this issue on Galaxy Note 3. mm-camera-daemon hogs half of the CPU time and drains the battery. The stock camera app won't open and displays the notice 'Kamera angehalten' (camera stopped). After rebooting, the process disappears. Turned on the CPU monitoring tool to see what starts this. Fro example, the process terminates normally after using camera...

And the same with a Motorola moto g and Android 4.4. I have the phone since about 5 days and since the day before yesterday I'm facing the same problem. mm-qcamera-daemon uses between 21 and 25% of the battery and you can watch the battery going down.
It started after linking the stock cam - or one of the other apps - to the start screen, I think. (I tried several photo apps during the last days to find one to replace the stock app with, but now that I discovered the power leak I deinstalled all of them again, rebooted the phone and so on, but the daemon stays.)
I'll have to check my other apps which are allowed to use the camera, but Hangouts for example can not be deinstalled (even with root).

PS: that's not a &quot;Priority: small&quot;-defect, because with this the battery doesn't make it half a day.

Update from post #19 12-13-13

Since factory reset on Note 3, with installation of new 32gb micro sd card. (Previously simply installed old sd card from Samsung rugby)
Battery drain, overheating and camera freeze have ceased.

Now enjoying my new phone. I hope this helps some of you, it was so frustrating....

Fingers crossed! I think I might have fixed it on my moto g.

The phone runs 4.4 KitKat (bootloader unlocked, rooted) and I tried several photo apps, when I discovered the prob (battery usage 23% - phone off after 6 to 8 hours).

I don't know what caused the problem (maybe linking the camara app to the start screen) and I don't know which action I tried really got me rid of it, but here's what I did:

- First I deinstalled all camera apps (and some apps which use the cam, like Skype).

- Then I copied &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot; _and_ &quot;mm-qcamera-app&quot; to a newly created folder on the SD card and after that deletet the two files in root/system/bin. (For that I used app &quot;Root Explorer&quot; (ES Datei Explorer would do the same); remember to switch folder /bin from &quot;read only r/o&quot; to &quot;read and write r/w&quot; before).

- Deactivated stock camera app &quot;Motorola Kamera&quot;.

- Cleaned cache

- Re-activated stock camera app (and installed app &quot;LG Camera&quot; for testing)

- Test: camera didn't work, of course.

- Copied &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot; and &quot;mm-qcamera-app&quot; back to root/system/bin again.

- Test: camara worked with both apps, but only with a resolution of 320x240px instead of HD 1280x720px.

- Cleaned cache again (just to be sure)

- Tried to fix rights with app &quot;ROM Manager&quot; but to be sure I also went back to app &quot;Root Explorer&quot; --&gt; folder root/system/bin --&gt; changed rights' settings for &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot; and &quot;mm-qcamera-app&quot; to rwxr-xr-x, as it was given for all other files.


Since then it seems to be fixed. For two days the battery usage was down to 6-8% and today mm-gcamera-daemon vanished completely from the usage list though I used the camera in the meantime (battery was down to 50% after one day instead of being completely off after 6-8 hours, as it had been before).

As I said, I don't know which of the steps above were responsible for preventing the process to suck dry the battery, but I hope the phone will keep this state and maybe it might be helpfull for some of you to try the same, too.

Good luck!

Hello everyone.  I see how there are serious attempt of finding workarounds for this issue.  There is a bug in the mm-qcamera-daemon that does not disconnect the camera service in some scenarios.  While some apps seem to be triggering this bug; debugging the problem the way you guys are (by clearing cache and resets) are not going to totally fix the problem.  Some other apps may actually be connecting to the camera service and not letting go.  There are a number of things that could be happening.  The original concern for this bug issue was not a battery drain or background usage but rather the fact that it is using 100% more cpu power than it should to accomplish the task.

If you track it down to a specific app please write the test case here.

The best thing you can do is disable anything that uses the camera without your explicit request. ( face login, etc )

Same problem here; Running a Nexus 5 bought yesterday. Using it as a company phone, encrypted, with all the different kinds of login disabled excepting PIN; I also have location, bluetooth, 3g and data disabled, . Have used Camera once and the  mm-qcamera-app process drained most of the battery in 6 hours from a full charge. Also charging takes forever (3% in 20 minutes). No additional apps for camera use since I am not taking pics with the phone very often. Please advise on resolution.

Regarding comment #51... I'm developing a rather advanced video engine for Android presently and thus am dealing with all sorts of camera issues including the mm-qcamera-daemon problem.  The problems seem definitely related to Qualcomm SoCs which are behaving badly in app lifecycle situations. To prevent issues for my test app / middleware it's necessary to of course shut down any connections to the camera via the camera API, but I've found that seemingly to get things to not hang sporadically the app must always manually call finish() for the Activity interacting with the camera. This means calling finish() when the home button is pressed and not let the Activity interacting with the camera linger even if release() is called on any active camera instance from the camera API.

While I can't authoritatively say this solves the symptoms to this problem I haven't seen any problems on Qualcomm based devices after making this change to my test app and I'm testing it all the time on the Nexus 5 presently. This of course is for developers of camera apps and not an end user / consumer solution.  There seems to be some interplay with the Activity lifecycle / OS / and Qualcomm camera service implementation that is definitely different than other Android devices w/ different SoC manufacturers. I tried to debug and do everything possible to avoid a manual call to Activity-&gt;finish() when leaving focus of my test camera app. That is the only thing that stopped camera issues on Qualcomm based devices.

Re #53 as long as you call &quot;release()&quot; for the camera; it doesn't seem to ever hang for me unless there was a violent crash.  Depending on the device, mm-qcamera-deamon may force close the connection after a period of time or may totally foobar the device until next restart.  This seems to be very device (possibly driver version) specific.

On the 2013 Nexus 7, using 25% or 1 core at 100% is absurd amount of cpu power just to draw the camera to the screen.  Either every reporting tool I can use is incorrectly reporting the cpu usage or something is seriously wrong with the qualcomm camera driver.

@ #54  My money is on a fubared Qualcomm camera driver &amp; unstable MediaCodec implementation on Qualcomm SoCs as well. 

Yeah, why I mention that I can't authoritatively claim calling finish() helps specifically with the symptoms posted in this issue it was definitely necessary for using MediaCodec on Qualcomm based devices. Unfortunately a start / stop / initialization cycle of MediaCodec crashes in certain situations on Qualcomm SoCs where it works on all others I've tested thus far and this crashing situation certainly triggers the &quot;violent crash&quot; scenario hence not reaching a call to &quot;release&quot; for the active camera instance reliably thereby further triggering the symptoms in this issue with mm-qcamera-daemon, etc. It's a big mess really from the dev side of things regarding side effects of clearly unstable / untested APIs. 

For example one of the more exotic MediaCodec crash scenarios was recording a video in my app then hitting &quot;home&quot; going to MXPlayer to play the video and when returning to my camera app MediaCodec would hang and crash no matter what I did to properly set things up and of course just on Qualcomm based devices.  This doesn't occur if &quot;finish()&quot; is called when leaving my test app. 

It's a bandaid that has thus far brought stability to my current camera / MediaCodec app efforts on all devices with no problems since I included it. Not ideal at all and kind of a pain, but less bad than crashes and the symptoms in this issue. I exhaustively tried everything else as far as control flow goes before resorting to the &quot;finish&quot; hack.

I'm in on this too. I use GN3 with stock ROM on AT&amp;T. Phone heats, battery drains super fast, &amp; this daemon process as at 51% of battery usage constantly. Rebooting the device seems to help, but it recurs. 
Since the phone is useless in this state, I will be returning it within the hour.

Ever since I returned my phone to factory settings (a week or so ago), and
reinstalled all apps that I was using except for Greenify (or any of the
other &quot;battery saving apps&quot; that are out there), this problem has not
occurred.
I really suspect that a hard shutdown of camera-using apps will cause the
process to panic, and overrun the CPU.

Of course, this is just anecdotal, and it is a bug, the daemon should not
do this. Not using battery saving apps has solved my problem.

We have seen that debug traces gets overflowed with thousands of camera face detection events per second as soon as any app related to camera use is started. It is probably related to the above. This happens on Note 10.2 2014.
Turning face detection off has no influence.
This is a typical debug message:
E/mm-camera( 315): module_faceproc_client_send_info:1763] face_cnt 0
It is urgent to get this fixed.

Nexus 5, 4.2.2.

No face log-in. I don't know of any other apps that access the camera by itself.

I think my case may have been triggered by Waze when it was trying to detect a hand wave. Reboot seems to help.

It seems to be definitely triggered by apps that access camera. Not sure if this is an issue with the camera API usage practice or bug in the driver/daemon.

I just got my first smartphone less then a week ago after giving up my old LG flip phone that I for 10 years. I got the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and everything has been great up until this afternoon when I noticed the phone getting really warm to the touch and my battery plummeting down to nothing in a matter of an hour.  I noticed the mm-qcamera-dameon was at 66%. I had yahoo messenger on my phone and all was well with it. I tried to use it this evening but I couldn't get it to work now.  I did download a few apps today but have since deleted them in thinking they may have caused the problem.  I haven't used the camera since the first day I got the phone last week.  This is ruining my first smartphone experience really fast.  Also, my phone has been charging for the past 4 hours and it still is at only 76% in being charged.  My old phone only took about 2 hrs. max to charge up, if that.

On #51 and #61: The enormous flood of face detections start for any app using the camera. So, it is not directly related to any app.
And it starts regardless of if you have any face detection function activated in the app. It seems to be the face detection logic spinning free without any wait time between the detection scans. Or it gets triggered by some indication from the camera that there is a new image delivered to scan and that indication appears more than once per image. (Just guessing on these reasons )

On #53 You say you call finish() when you exit the app. But don't you have the problem while the app using the camera is running?

@65

It's hard to say if there is any extra drain on the battery during the operation of my app in normal conditions since my test app is a demo for rather intense OpenGL camera manipulation / video engine middleware. It's a bit of a battery hog to begin with given all that it is doing and I'm really working the GL pipeline in a way that I haven't been able to do with SoCs prior to Snapdragon 800 / Adreno 330, but &quot;After Effects in your pocket&quot; will do that!   

So, yes, indeed the device gets hot particularly around the camera itself at times.  I haven't had much chance to do a detailed analysis during runtime regarding battery usage or breakdown between my app / GL / potential camera service other areas, etc. I'll be able to tune and test things better once I get more recent devices to test with soon.

My older devices like the Galaxy Nexus on 4.3 don't have any problems except not being able to support nearly as much functionality due to an older GPU. 

As mentioned in #55 I have to call finish() especially on Qualcomm SoCs to reset anomalies with MediaCodec that will crash in various strange and complex / indeterminate ways otherwise that  caused problems with the camera service / functionality when the app was not running or when restarting after sending the app into the background.  

As things go there area a lot of problems surrounding the camera functionality on the N5 / Android 4.3 &amp; 4.4.x for devs and end users alike. It seems like things are stuck in a limbo phase between the next major revision of the camera APIs and everyone is going to suffer for a bit.

Hi, everyone!
This is for all, who are not developing but just want to get rid of this nuisance.

What I wrote in #50 about three weeks ago still works.

&quot;Longterm tests&quot; - meaning: start video recording and let it run until the battery is nearly down - with both remaining apps on the phone (Motorola stock app and LG Camera free)lead to a usage of mm-qcamera-daemon of about 7%, which is down to 2% after a few hours of normal usage and complete gone overnight.

Knock on wood that thiswill last, Good luck to all who will test on their phones!

Noticed this same issue today. Using Nexus 5 32GB and did not start any camera apps in days. Suddenly this morning phone feels hot to touch and battery drained very fast. Most of it (60+ percent) spent on mm-qcamera-daemon process. Please elevate this issue, this is not minor, it's major battery drain and as far as I could find lot of people are having this happen. I don't use snapchat (seen some relating this issue to that app but nope in my case). Google, please fix, this is ruining my Nexus experience.

I've noticed this issue lately on my stock N5 and, while I haven't done any extensive testing, it seems coincidental that it happens after I take a picture and then share it to something. Facebook, gmail, etc.. Just the times that I am in the camera app and click the share function.  My guess is that it doesn't properly give the exit commands when that happens and my workaround will be to exit the camera app and then share manually from the photo viewer.  Again, haven't tested and don't have time at the moment, this is just a theory.  From reading what other people have posted on this it seems to be similar symptoms no matter what app they are posting to.

My issue started after I connected my AT&amp;T Note 3 to my computer and backed it up via the Samsung Kies 3 software. Kies must have done something during the backup. From my research, the problem resides in the external SD Card. I have a SanDisk 64 GB Class 10 micro and it must have went haywire during the Kies back up. I plugged my phone into my computer and backed up all the contents of my SD Card to a folder on the desktop. Then I went into the settings menu under General then Storage. I tried to format the SD Card. It said it was formatting but never actually deleted the pictures or video. So I unmounted the card popped it out of the phone and put it back in. Then I did the format again. This time it worked and all my files were deleted. This problem has happened to me before and then went away for a long while. The fix that worked for me was formatting micro SD card.

My Nexus 5 stock with 4.4.2 Kitkat, no roms or roots installed, running well from last November since last days ago, when the battery drain come to max level caused by the process above. I restart the phone many times without success, the camera is unusable and the phone has to be recharged in few hours.
This is not a small bug, but a serious problem that come to return many devices to the vendor and to cancel what we know as the Nexus Experience, please solve it ASAP.

Since a few days ago, I also have this Problem. I also don't use snapchat. Maybe it is a bug in the Google play services released a few days ago?

Put me down for having this problem crop up in the last 24 hours.  I've owned this Nexus 5 since release and have had no battery issues until now.  No snapchat or yahoo for me either.  55% of battery is being consumed by mm-camera-darmon and cut is pegged all the time.

I am having this issue aswell on my Nexus 5 since yesterday. Had the Nexus 5 since launch and no major issues. This mm-qcamera-daemon only appeared in the battery stats today and it's used up 49% battery. Hardly got through 4 hours! Had to recharge. How can a process/issue like this come out of nowhere. Google really needs to look into this issue!!!

Can we try to isolate the problem a bit better. My problem is #61, that a lot of extra CPU is wasted while an app is used that I want to run. So it is not exactly the same as all these reports about spontantaneous use of CPU for something camera related. But close enough to suspect that they have the same cause. It may be hardware related. Or a bug that shows up differently depending on how software is loaded. 

In our case, an enormous flood of face-detection indications starts as soon as any camera related app is started.

It would likely help if someone else could check in their system if it is the same there.

Take a trace with LogCat as described in 
<a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/debugging-projects.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/debugging-projects.html</a>

And check what reports are created very often while the battery is drained.

It is interesting that there are so many different reports on what helps. Different uninstallations and reinstallations. It seems that stirring around in memory causes the bug to be inactivated. Such things can depend on uninitialized variables or peeking in memory that does not belong to the module.

Since we get the face detection indication without requesting face detection, it seems to me that the face detection logic that should be done in background maximum once per image is spinning free as rapid as it can. 

Is it the same cause in all these spontantaneous battery drain situations? Check the logs!

As far as I can tell this started after I used an App called &quot;ScanToPDF Free&quot;  When I started the App, the camera crashed and wouldn't even open from the camera App.  I had to reboot the handset (Stock Nexus 5) to get the camera active again.

Opening ScanToPDF Free this time worked and a picture was taken.  However, the next day I noticed the fast battery drain and found this issue.  All I did was reboot the handset again and all has been fine.

My thought is that it could be any App that has access to the camera that could cause this fault.  It may be that the App crashes or just is not designed well and causes this drain.  I did not uninstall the App.  I have used it again since without fault and without recurrence of the &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot; fault.

I am removing my Star on this topic, because I feel it IS to do with 3rd Party Apps and NOT Android Firmware.

Good luck to all in solving this issue for your devices.

While I have some 3rd party apps using the camera I *think* the only camera accessing apps I'd used in the reboot cycle when I encountered this were Hangouts and Camera. No problems I could see with Hangouts, but the next day Camera refused to start and was just giving me &quot;Can't connect to camera&quot; error. That was the first hint something wasn't quite right, noticed the battery drain few hours later, it took less than three hours to drain the battery from full charge.

I'm a Nexus 5 owner. About one week ago I noticed that the camera app wasn't working at all (&quot;Can't connect to camera&quot; message). Since the last two days I noticed a heavy battery drain (the daemon takes about 60 %) and heat. I uninstalled snapchat, skype, tried to restart the phone, delete the camera shortcut, but nothing works, the daemon keeps operating. This IS a major issue, please fix it, my Nexus 5 doesn't even last a day.

It all has happened for the last week or so... First it was Foursquare that started draining battery like mad, with the app being active during a bunch of minutes despite I was not using it. Then the infamous camera daemon. 

I haven't seen any problem after uninstalling Foursquare but I after reading your comments that doesn't look like the root cause at all :/

I dont think any app is responsible for this major drain.

I have done no major changes to my Nexus 5 and this issue came into existence from nowhere.

qccamera-daemon seems to be one of the issue and eats upto 35% of my usage but I don't feel it's the only one draining battery.

same here with my Nexus 5
facing this issue of &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot; which is eating up the battery like its hungry for years.
@Google, #android#team please have a fix for this, resetting to factory default or uninstalling an app should not be a solution.

A lot of people believe it's snap chat that's causing the problem but I never installed snap chat and I still face this problem with the phone. In fact any app that uses camera seems to trigger this process and then it does not terminate causing fat battery drain for my phone.

Same Problem here. Tried different &quot;fixes&quot;, none seems to be working.
Problem does not seem to be related to any app - just started &quot;out of the blue&quot;.

I found this thread after having the same issue for the first time (Nexus 5 4.4.2 16GB). 

I have a very strong hint about this (or just a HUGE coincidence): the battery drain from mm-qcamera-daemon started after I enabled the camera cloud backup from G+ photos app. I have never had this issue before doing this, so it should be the culprit.

Nexus 5 16 gb, 4.4.2 rooted

Happened to me last night (mm-qcamera-daemon the culprit), drained about 20-30% of my battery. Started while I accidentally clicked on the flash icon and then could not disable flash (have power toggles in the dropdown menu). Went into the camera app to try to disable flash and the camera crashed (same as post #103 and then a crash, message stays on the screen for a split second). Rebooted the device and the flash was still a bit unresponsive (didnt toggle on/off like it normally does, but with a lot more lag). The camera worked fine. In the period of about 20-30 mins 20% of the battery was gone. Funny enough the problem stopped abruptly as I switched my phone to airplane mode and went to bed. Phone works fine today.

Also I should mention that I do have photo upload to google enabled ever since I got the phone (2 months), but this is the first time it happened and the first time i saw mm-qcamera in the battery usage.

This issue started for me a few days ago on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I have instagram, snapchat, as well as lots of other camera styled apps. Never had an issue until the past week. Currently it is chewing up 40% of my battery. Tried uninstalling snapchat, barcode scanner, instagram, path, facebook, vine etc. rebooted, still there. This really shouldn't be an issue going on 5 months without a resolution. Are google even looking into this?

This just started happening to me. My camera started acting funny today. It had a black screen, then my phone started to get hot and the battery drained in about 2 hours from a full charge. I have a Galaxy Note 3, Android Version 4.3. I have had no issues before today. I dont have Snapchat. I do have Skype, Facebook, and Dropbox.

Same here with Nexus 5 KitKat 4.4.2, appears to have just started of the past week. I went to take a picture via 'Voxer' on Saturday and saw the 'cannot connect to camera' error message and had to reboot to get it working again. Since then, it keeps re-ocurring. Wow, it goes through the battery like nothing I've ever seen. I had the camera app button on my homescreen so have now removed this in the hope the problem goes away.

Likewise I discovered this bug when I went to use the camera and it wouldn't open, soon after that my phone died as it ran out of battery, the culprit appeared to be this camera daemon.  Now it seems to happen sporadically.
I've not got snapchat or instagram, in this case the only apps I've actively used before it happens are Facebook, google+, googleNow and cameraFX.  I've used FB, G+ and Google now without it happening so I'm guessing it's probably whenever something opens the camera.  Current solution is to reboot daily and when I use the camera!

I don't have SnapChat or InstaGram install - never have, and I also have this problem.

I'm pretty sure I've had this problem for a while but didn't notice till now.

I was really annoyed by slow recharge, and when the phone started getting really hot with no apps started I looked at battery usage and found mm-qcamera-daemon using 34% of all CPU time.

I've had my N5 for months and this problem started a few weeks ago - maybe several weeks ago.

Yes, it is quite evident now that 
1. it appears from various camera-related apps. 
2. And it shows up as the title says in extra CPU usage by the mm-qcamera-daemon.
3. Some have succeeded to get rid of the problem by various reshuffling of apps, system components or SD-card contents.
4. Nexus and some Samsung and one Motorola have appeared in the reports. 
5. On NOTE 2014 we have seen that it is Face Detection looping wildly in mm-qcamera-daemon, but no one have reported what activities get logged in any other device.
I have succeeded to report to Samsung today but with no promise for rapid action. 

In #50 a range of actions were reported, that together got rid of the problem. 
It would be valuable if someone could test one of these actions at a time. I would suggest just removing and putting back mm-qcamera-daemon as the first one to try.

#84 describes my experience exactly. 
Always have ended my days of light use with 65-80% battery remaining. Never installed snapchat or yahoo or instagram, never used face unlock, wasn't even using my camera this weekend, but all of a sudden yesterday the battery hit 14% by dinnertime! Restarting hasn't worked; today it's draining quickly too. My Nexus 5 is nearly ruined, until Google fixes this.

Same issue for me, and I don't use Snapchat, Yahoo or Instagram. It's been like that since more or less a week. In my case, as some reported, I had also the issue of the camera not working properly at some point (and for no apparent reason). I restarted the phone and the camera was there, but since, I have been dealing with this battery issue. 

I have been trying to identify which app could be causing the trouble, so far unsuccessfully. I installed and app (os Monitor) which helped me to identify at what point the service associated with this (QcrilMsgTunnelService) started. It might be just coincidence, but at some point it told me that the service had been up for 8 hrs. 23 min. and XX secs, and that was exactly the amount of time Whatsapp have been running according to the same OS monitor, so it might be Whatsapp (I haven't installed it yet, I'll wait until the service &quot;hangs around&quot; again and then will double check if whatsapp and/or any other app started running at the same time the service did). 

But even if I identify the responsible app and get rid of it, I'd like this issue &quot;radically&quot; solved, because otherwise it will be just a matter of time before another app activates it.

I strace it when qq-camera-daemon eating power, &quot;select&quot; is looping because one pipe is broken. The pipe's fd is a fixed number 17. 
A workroud way is to monitor qq-camera-daemon, when it is connected and pipe 17 disapear, just killed it. It will be restart automatically.

Who can fix this bug?

Same issue with stock Nexus 5, 4.4.2. Did not altered my app set in any way. I use the phone for a month now, never had such an issue before ~5 days ago. Never used snapchat - issue may manifest itself after any session with camera, most commonly through WhatsApp.
I suspect some recent update to Play Services or similar system-level silently-updating app does not behave well with Qualcomm camera driver.

Happened to me as well..
Nexus 5, 4.2.2 32 GB

I didn't used neither camera nor any other application. When open the battery stat was surprised to see that battery drain was caused by camera-daemon. Was not able to launch camera post that. Reboot fixed the issue though..

This happened twice to me now. Nexus 5 stock with no photo back-up turned on (G+, dropbox) and no custom camera app. Restarting the device seems to fix the issue, but not for good. Clearly it is related to the standard camera app, as I have got the &quot;Can't connect to the camera&quot; error message prior this issue. I think, restoring the phone is not a viable solution!

Same problem with my wife's Nexus 5. I guess there is no solution. I can't believe this is a small priority still, it's a huge problem. Battery life is a number one priority for 99% of the smartphone community. Is there a proper way to report the problem to Google?

No luck with restarting the phone. Couldn't connect to the camera randomly. Seems like a recent matter. I spent two weeks road tripping across the states, using the phone as my primary camera most of the trip with no issues at all. It's as of recent that the battery's been draining fast. Unplugged this morning around 6:40, it's 8:40 now and I'm down to 59% already. Struggles to charge overnight.

Rebooting hasn't done anything for me.

mm-qcamera-daemon has been running between 43-51% on my phone.

After keeping up to date with this regarding mm-qcamera-daemon, somehow today that process is no longer in the battery stats but I am still having issues with camera not opening. Says it 'cannot connect to camera' so the issue is still there. Only way to get camera working is to restart the phone. This bug seriously needs to be looked at.

I've been using the Nexus 5 phone fine since November but two days ago I started experiencing huge battery drains. Today I installed Battery Monitor Widget and saw that mm-qcamera-daemon is using up 49% of the processor. Powering off and on does not solve the issue even temporarily. Removing any camera related apps (Lomo in my case) also made no difference.
The Apps mentioned by others like Snapchat and yahoo messengar are not installed.  I even deleted all non-essential apps but nothing changes. I haven't tried factory reset yet but want to leave this as the final option. 

Really hope google is looking into this and announces something soon.

EXACT SAME PROBLEM!!! 
Nexus 5, 4.4.2 32 GB Version
Started happening yesterday. 
Right now after 3hrs 8mins on battery, down to 60% from 100% with near to no usage!  mm-qcamera-daemon at 45% battery usage, the next one is Mobile standby with 14%...

Totally unacceptable, someone get on a high profile website and report this as it's ridiculous that there is not even a 'Got it, working on it' from anyone on this problem.

Same for me,since a week on my stock n5: no yahoo no snapchat. Don't think it is caused by a particular app because this process can appear during the night whereas i'am slepping and not using the phone...

I'm having a similar issue. It started about a week, maybe two weeks ago, at first just the &quot;Cannot connect to camera&quot; error, and I noticed that mm-qcamera-daemon has been eating my battery. Normally the screen is the largest battery drain, but now this one process has at least doubled that. I thought Instagram might have been the culprit but I have uninstalled that with no change.

Sprint Nexus 5, Android 4.4.2.

It happened to me because of &quot;Clean Master&quot; app shortcut, to put search light on. I had to reset my phone initially to get rid of this issue and then by mistake I touched the searchlight to on in the status bar which triggered mm-qcamera-daemon and thus started draining my battery. I am on Nexus 5.
Will report to Clean Master as well. But i don't think it's an application specific issue. It has more to do with some underlying process which is running in a loop draining the battery.

This is happening to me on a Sprint/Ting Nexus 5. Phone gets hot and completely drains within 5 hours on standby, 2-3 hours if using it.

This is making my phone borderline unusable. I am seeing the mm-qcamera-daemon at over 50% battery usage, and also getting &quot;Cannot connect to camera&quot; errors when trying to run the camera app.

This is a new phone, and if this isn't fixed I'm going to have to return it. I would much rather see this patched, since I like the phone otherwise.

2 Days back suddenly my battery gets drain within 7 to 8Hrs in which mm-qcamera-daemon is the guy who eats most of it. And after seeing one of the Post I check my camera, it was not working. I tried most of the hits above, but nothing worked.
After clearing all app cache, temp files and restarting 6 times, now camera is working. 
I let full batter drain and charging on shutdown mode.
Hoping it should work this time. 
Will keep posting how it goes.
Fingers crossed !!!

Nexus 5 with Android 4.4.2 here. I'm using ART instead of Dalvik.

Hangouts is my SMS app. I regularly use Pocket Casts, Play Music, YouTube, Timely, Chrome, Google Maps, Tumbler, Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Google Plus, Google Drive, Google Keep, GitHub, DashClock Widget, Tasks, SKype, Firefox, Google Authenticator, Play Books, Dungeon Keeper, and Ingress. I have full-device encryption enabled with a PIN prompt.

It was months ago that I was updated to Android 4.4.2, so I don't believe that update caused this issue by itself. I've only had this issue for the last week or so.

I do know that Google Play Services updates separately and secretly, so it's currently my number 1 suspect. I'm on version 4.2.23 (1035512-038) right now.

I don't know what else to mention. This bug is now happening to me on a daily basis and I have no idea what triggers it.

Same thing, Nexus 5 4.4.2 Stock, no rooting.
Just started happening about 2 weeks. Restart fixes it temporarily,
Camera app installed  : Camera360 (just uninstalled and monitoring the phone now)
Other Camera using app : 
1. Lookout Security (at their cam-lock feature that takes front cam pic when failed to unlock device)
2. The stock Camera app itself
3. Facebook when uploading / taking camera
4. Skype when doing video calls
5. Google + ?
6. Instagram for taking pic 

Any Solutions yet ?

thought it was related to me installing telegram, but it happened again after removing telegram as the last app I had added to my N5. This must be something system related and is more than just annoying. Happy to help by installing any beta updates of any kind to get rid of it!

Same problem, but using Samsung S4 (GT-I9506). Not rooted.
mm-qcamera-daemon drains battery, camera won't start, performance slows downs (apps responsetime increases), but it's not getting that much hotter (?). 
Reboot helps for a while.
 
I've had the S4 since december running Android 4.2 with no problems at all. Troubles started 3 days ago when I, using Samsung Kies for PC-connection, upgraded to Android 4.3. This triggered updating/checking 200+ apps, widgets etc. Put it on charge for the night. The next day the camera couldn't open :(.

I've joined &quot;The mm-qcamera-daemon curse&quot;-Club...

Nexus 5. I'm having a similar issue. It started about a week, maybe two weeks ago, at first just the &quot;Cannot connect to camera&quot; error, and I noticed that mm-qcamera-daemon has been eating my battery. Normally the screen is the largest battery drain, but now this one process has at least doubled that.. Please help google.

Nexus 5, same as others, the daemon started eating battery some time during last week or so, rebooting temporarily fixes the issue then it just restarts again. Same symptoms, phone gets warm and batter is drained in a couple of hours or at most half a day. Please fix!

I'm having this issue without any of the apps listed installed.  I've turned off the various features that require the camera (such as Air View, Air Gesture, Smart Pause, Smart Scroll, and Smart Stay), and this seems to have made a differencewith my Galaxy Note 3.

Same issue. Camera does not connect and battery drains like crazy. I uninstalled a battery widget app which for some reason needed camera permission to see if this fixes the problem. I do not believe that it is taking so long to fix this bug. I am so disappointed. I love my Nexus 5.

Update from my post yesterday: I uninstalled Instagram, but didn't see any change until I restarted my phone. I have now done that, and my phone is behaving normally again without camera or battery problems.

Same issue. The first time was friday for my nexus 5. I uninstalled some app who use app camera. It didn't work. The same issue appeared today. I don't want to restore my device. 
Please, find a solution... :(

I have a Nexus 5 (latest Kit Kat updates), and noticed this happening when I had unplugged the charger and opened the camera app from the &quot;lock&quot; screen by accident. I closed the camera app and the screen was unlocked. I then noticed the battery drain later that day. After a recharge, noticed the same thing continuing and found this post group on the problem. I have followed several postings, and so far it has not come back.. I did notice that when I went into Apps, All apps tab there is a &quot;Reset&quot; option for apps. I used that vs doing a wipe. and noticed that Face recognition was running, when I never used that, its gone now as I stopped it.

I experience the same issue, with an almost-stock Nexus 5. Everything was OK so far, a day I installed Skype, then I got the issue. I uninstalled Skype, but the issue still goes on. I have no other camera app. Now battery is discharging very fast and phone is getting very hot.

I started using Skype recently and that's around the time that the problem started for me. 

Setting up my phone after a factory reset takes forever, so I really want to avoid doing that.

It would be nice if a google representative could post a message on here to say they are looking into it, or request some specific information to help resolve this.

I have this problem on my stock Nexus 5. Camera started to refuse working sometimes after I installed &quot;Instagram&quot;. I have to reboot to fix this.
Also today I noticed 45% battery drain because of &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot; process, and the camera is not responding,

This is a huge problem and seems that it was activated these days. Suddenly all people are complaining about this battery drainage. Stop blaming third party apps, they are not causing this issue. it is something about the Android OS that is causing this issue. 

Yesterday I experienced that problem, the nexus 5 camera app was all black and crashed, did not work at all, I had to reset the phone and then this in this morning?

Hope we will get a patch asap.

Just noticed this thread &quot;only&quot; had 57 comments in 4 month...and now rockets with 150+ the since 20.feb.2014.

The MS OneDrive update from SkyDrive:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.skydrive" rel="nofollow">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.skydrive</a>
was released 18.feb.2014

Like #211, I've uninstalled my newly installed MS OneDrive app and rebooted.
Now having 20+ apps active, mm-qcamera-daemon still hasn't returned :-)

Probably OS related but triggered by different apps, in my case OneDrive (?)

Started getting this issue today as well. Was on charger all night and when I checked email in the morning after unplugging, noticed the battery was already down to 90% after 2 minutes of use! First issue with my Nexus and it came out of nowhere.

I noticed that chrome had an update after reboot, mm-qcamera-daemon not on the list, but now there is a chrome process leading the battery usage list.

Now getting this issue as well on my Note 3 with stock rom.

Started about 5 or 6 days ago.  Initially I had the face detection eye permanently in the notification screen so I thought it might be something to do with that and disabled it, which hasn't helped.

Had this issue for the last month or so. Had been using the camera a lot. Snap chat and camera mainly. Noticed that the lag from this process had started draining probably a few days ago. Digging through threads and blogs,  I followed two suggestions. 

Install greenify and trustlook Antivirus. 

Not sure if those two combined or the two separate worked. But my battery life has rose back to the way when I first got it. 

I had ran a full scan through trustlook. Greenify I had put on hibernate list apps like waze and anything else they suggested. I didn't greenify snap. 

Hope that helps some people.

Having the same battery drain issues with mm-qcamera-daemon.  Nexus 5 - 4.4.2.  No snapchat or yahoo messenger.   I do have Instagram and I did install Keychain around when this started.  Some days are fine, others terrible.  Mystery, but at least I can see I am not alone.

No Instagram, Snapchat or Yahoo messenger installed, but I still get serious battery drain on the N5, and usually 20-25% of that is from &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot;. Hope this is fixed soon.

Same problem. 4.4.2 - nexus 5. Battery's never been great but it hit a whole new level of terrible today... Not sure when it started exactly for me. Tried deleting snapchat/Facebook/Skype/whatsapp and a couple others that might have been able to access the camera but absolutely nothing has worked and I'm really hoping to not have to go the factory reset route.

For me this issue happens every night when I charge it. In the morning I will find out it has 10% battery left while plugged in the charger all night. I'd need to reboot and during the day I can charge again. Rather bizarre. I do not think its app related as I do not use my phone's camera at all. Must be the 4.4's problem.

Joining the club - Nexus 5 16GB, stock rom, using it for 3 months. This morning missed my wake-up alarm and found out that battery is on 2%, although it was fully charged before I went to sleep and was in airplane mode.

Ok +Google +Android we're all calling you out on this one. It's obviously a bug that needs to be fixed and it's not a very good advert for Google, Android either.

Please acknowledge this issue and investigate it and provide fix timescales.

That's all we're asking. Thanks.

This issue is now a constant 'feature' for me. Battery drops faster than gravity and I can't open the camera app. Please see attached screenshots.

Completely stock 4.4.2. Locked boot loader etc.

Having this issue since the last couple of days. Have done a soft reset as suggested in one of the blogs. Takes a very long while to charge as well.

Google N5 32GB 4.4.2
P.S: I think the priority is no longer &quot;Small&quot;

This is rumoured to be a compatibility issue between the latest Skype release and the qualcomm camera driver. Uninstalling Skype has so far resolved this issue for me, but I'm keeping a close eye.

(Sorry, I didn't note the Skype version before uninstalling it)

This is happening to me too, on a Nexus5 without Instagram. I have tried uninstalling and disabling various apps to do with the camera, several soft resets, restarting in safe mode, nothing works. I'm not willing to do a hard reset and reinstall all my useful apps. This is clearly a widespread Android issue, not 3rd party app problem. I have to have a device with a good battery for my work. I'm going back to my Iphone 4, and if this can't be resolved I'll get rid of it anf buy an Iphone 5S.

Nexus 5 here, same problem but I've noticed that it's Snapchat that's causing the wakelovk. I uninstall the app and then restart the phone and then the problem vanishes. I've had no other apps that has caused this.

Same thing here on a Note 3. Updated SkyDrive to OneDrive yesterday, and it 'offered' to upload pictures. I thought cool, and accepted. Not cool. Battery drained overnight, while plugged in, from 60% when I plugged it in to beeping at me this morning because the battery was low. mm-qcamera-daemon and Google Play Services were the two battery hogs, using 47% and 34% of battery, respectively. Uninstalled OneDrive after reading comment #211, and phone is on charger, up to 47% charge after 20 minutes (from 9%).

I've uninstalled OneDrive but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be the main cause (though it may cause the problem to be more frequent). Since I don't use Snapchat or any other frequently mentioned apps, I suspect Google Play Services - I have version  4.2.43 1035512-038

What I tried did worked for me (Post #163). 
No more I see the problem, its been 36Hrs after I didn't what I posted. 

Hope in future it should not occur.

Hope Google will send fix soon with this if there any other bug. 
Cheers!!!

Hi,
I had the same issue this morning(when my alarm clock ringed, I had 3% of battery left &gt;_&lt;).

I tried many things (like force quit some apps), but it was useless.
Miraculously, after charging my phone at 100%, the problem dissapeared.

But I did notice one thing, it seems like the battery interface was bugging.I had an app(candy crush) that was consuming 11%, but when i shut it down, it still consume 11%. o_O

I have a Nexus 5. Yesterday I tried to open the camera app and I got the &quot;Can't connect to the camera&quot; error. Rebooted the phone and the app worked fine. Charged my phone to 100% last night. Put the phone in my suit coat pocket and noticed it was hot. End result was 100% battery drain in 5 hours. mm-qcamera-daemon was at 40% battery usage. Phone is charging now, will report back with updates.

I ran into this exact issue on my N5 and mm-qcamera-daemon was at 40% battery usage and draining my battery within 8 hours. The only solution I had was a hard phone reset. So far, that solved my problem but now I have to be very careful of what apps to install. This is a frustrating bug and limits my usage of my smartphone. How this passed internal QA before release is a mystery to me. Please fix this bug!

Nexus 5, 16Gb, 4.4.2, drains 50% of battery in 4-5 hrs. &quot;Cannot connect to camera&quot; occurs occasionally, solved by reboot. mm-qcamera-daemon the culprit so far. No messaging apps.

Note3, Happened to me a couple days ago for the first discernable time (meaning I'll usually be around 50% by the end of the day, but was at 50% within hours), reboot didn't help (although it did help getting camera functionality back), turned off &quot;Air View&quot; and fully charged overnight once down to ~30% and haven't seen it since (have used camera since, but have been killing the task immediately after to be safe. Most definitely not acceptable, but I'll be able to test a little more over the weekend.

I originally posted back in #112. Right after that I stopped hangouts. The problem went away. Today I started hangouts again and the problem came back. Every time I went to take a picture the phone would shut down and the battery was being drained.  As soon as I stopped hangouts everything went back to normal.

It happens yesterday for the first time, after Reboot it appears again this afternoon, then I tried to remove Clean Master  (I saw somewhere that it could be the cause) and reboot again, but after ten minutes, it appears once again.
Now after the third reboot in 2 days, I've removed data and cache from all third-part-apps that have access to camera (including whatsapp), and uninstalling Gplus (someone blame the upload in gplus for this bug).
I've N5 stock (ART), no yahoo, no snapchat.
I'm getting really nervous, I hope google will solve soon.

Ok, is anyone experiencing this problem and DOESN'T have Skype installed? Since uninstalling Skype, the problem has gone away, which is in itself promising, because I've had it all week and no matter what I've tried the camera daemon vampire has always returned.

I ran my nexus 5 in &quot;Safe Mode&quot; for a day and I did not see qcamera process draining my battery then. On the flipside, when I restarted my phone to come out of safe mode, all my widgets and apps had been messed around with. A lot of my contacts lost their profile pictures and what not. I don't recommend it.

I have checked a few different devices. I have just looked at the cpu usage when using the camera. 

Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 (just factory reset) shows mm-qcamera-daemon on top of the cpu user list
Galaxy S4 does not
Galaxy Tab 2 does not
An HP does not
An Acer does not.

Conclusion: It is hardware related. 

An interesting observation is that so many different successful hints on how to eliminate the problem are reported. It nearly looks as if changing something among files or apps may get rid of the problem. And that &quot;something&quot; is different for each case.

#210 Log is also very different from what I get. I have a flood of face detection notifications without any active face detection. See #61.

Also got this issue on my Nexus 5. Doesn't seem to be related to any of my apps as I used all the same apps on my old Nexus 4 and never had this problem so it looks like it's a system error and quite a major one too. Would hate to have my phone die on me on a trip without a charger due to an issue like this. Should be greater priority as it seems like a fairly major fault.

This started for me 3 days ago.  I took my phone off of the charger and by the time I got to work 40 minutes later my battery was at 7%. Yesterday I had to borrow a charger when it hit 7% for no reason.  Charged it to 37% and it was back down to 7% by the time I got home.  Today its draining but not as fast.  I haven't installed any apps.  It started the same morning that I got an AT&amp;T Update (no idea what for because it doesn't tell you).  I have a Note 3.  My camera works fine and I haven't noticed my system slowing but I have noticed my phone becomes very hot at random times.

I also experienced this issue today.  Stock Nexus 5.  Yesterday I noticed the camera app would throw an error and image was black.  I had to reboot before it would work again.  Today my battery drained to 10% within 4 hours after removing from charger.  I found this thread and rebooted which seemed to stop the drain.  I do not use Instagram, Facebook, or OneDrive/Dropbox photo uploads.  Recently updated apps include Chrome Browser, Google Now Launcher, Twitter, and Yelp.

Started for me also about 3 days ago. 
Please Please please star this issue at the top of this page; that's the only way Google will look into it.
I have a stock Android Nexus5 Kitkat since the launch ; not had any problems like this till 3 days ago; don't have Snapchat or yahoo messenger; so i think it is a base Android issue and directly caused by a 3rd party app. 

Nonetheless, I have just uninstalled Skype based on suggestions in some posts and have rebooted the phone.  Don't see the mm-qcamera-daemon anymore in my battery stats; however I don't know whether that's because of the reboot or because of the Skype uninstallation.

Keeping my fingers crossed and hoping those Google engineers look into the matter.

Can't believe it is still an issue after a month. Mine started a few days back, no new apps for camera are installed (never have installed snapchat, etc.). Camera cannot be connected sometimes and mm-qcamera-daemon is eating up battery. 

Please solve this, Google! Everyone else, please star the topic on the top.

This bug has been open since Sep/2013 and has priority small. All the Nexus 5 users like me are having less than 7 hours of battery life, which is unaceptable and google doesn't care. I can't believe this. If this is not fixed soon i might not buy another nexus device or may be moving to an iphone. I am really disapointed about this.

I had been having this problem almost every day since Feb. 18. I used the app aSpotCat to identify all the apps on the phone that use the camera, and looked at those that had been updated recently. I noticed that Skype had been updated on Feb 18, so I uninstalled it. That was a few days ago, and the problem hasn't recurred since.

I am also hit by this problem since a couple of days ago. My symptoms are:

1. Battery dies much faster than before doing the same use.
2. I can see process &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot; in the battery list using up much battery time
3. Re-charging phone takes longer than before
4. Using the phone (normal mail/web use) while recharging it (provided wall plug) even drains the battery 

Maybe to locate this problem further, is there a way to know which apps/processes are using the &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot; daemon??

Same problem in Nexus 5 and last days I was carefully checking the battery status every couple of hours. Last battery draining by our beloved camera-demon was yesterday when someone call me using Skype and I answered by using other device (so, it started ringing in the Nexus but I picked up in another device). 

Result: camera-demon activated and sucking.

NEXUS5 + SKYPE = &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot;

Seeing Camera Crashes and saw the same mm-qcamera-daemon on Nexus 5 32 GB Android 4.4.2.

Is there anyway to identify which apps are trying to call this service?

It sounds like an unelegant process that is causing hanging - which in turn is not checked by the apps calling it - resulting in continuous loop calls and hence the draining batteries...
A bug in the OS - which is not known/handled by the calling app.  The fact it's suddenly increased in number of users raising the issue must be due to code change - which I can't figure out what - there are too many apps to think about.  Was there anything in CORE APP OS changed recently?

I have the same issue for severeal weeks ago . I thought it was something about the google services updates but it seems I was wrong.

I´v uninstalled skype right now, as said in comments before , and i hope it solve the problem. 
Nevertheless i think it´s a OS problem not a third party app

I have been facing this issue as well. I hope Google fixes this soon.
Other day I didn't know why my phone was feeling warm even while I wasn't using.
Then I realized it's a camera issue when I wasn't able to use flashlight.
Rebooting does fix it but not sure when this issue would start again.
Also, cannot end this process manually.

Hope google fixes this soon. Let us make them increase priority by posting comment here.

Just to add to the conversation. Nexus 5 bought on day of release. No issues till two weeks ago with 'mm-qcamera-daemon'.

Called Google support, they had not heard of issue? Emailed Google support, they have not heard of issue?

Tried all the recommendations , removing apps, clearing cache, booting to safe mode and factory reset....temporary relief only.

Arggh, definiively a pain. Nexus 5 randomly gets stuck with this process and drains battery until shutdown and reboot. Tried removing apps until now without success. Sometimes it seems to happen after long (over night) charging periods with active phone. Is there a list of apps the seem to be the issue in most cases?

I've also been plagued with this issue for the last week and I seem to have resolved it.  

For background I initially tried some hard boots with no success, then I did a full factory reset.  That fixed the issue for about a day.  I called Google since I bought the phone through the play store and they were unfamiliar with the problem.  I directed the customer service rep to this thread and she was surprised by the number of cases, said she didn't have a solution but sent the standard &quot;what to do to extend battery life&quot; response.  

FIRST: Let Google know this is an issue.  Without a lot of us making noise they will not investigate and fix the problem and I do believe  (no evidence) it to be a system issue.  

SECOND here he what I did to fix it (so far).  
a) Uninstalled all 3rd party camera specific apps that I don't regularly use.  This included VSCO Cam, Flickr, VidTrim - Video, Vine and a few others.  
b) All other camera related apps remaining that I knew used the camera I disabled in settings.
c) Hard boot then turn off phone then charged fully while off
d) turn phone back on and enable the camera apps one app at a time to test to see if the problem returned.  

I've gone 2 full days without the problem coming back and my battery life is as good as it's ever been.  What solved the problem? No idea but for now it's gone.  I'm going to start to reinstall some of the apps I took off but they were not used much so I'll only install them when and if I actually need them.

This was a blind solution as I have no idea what caused the mm-qcamera-daemon problem in the first place but something I did in the steps above resolved it more permanently then the factory reset did.  Hopefully this helps some of you, short battery life sucks.  Good luck.

Moved from iOS to android on Tues and will be moving back ASAP if this doesn't get resolved. Phone dead in about 4hrs due to the daemon and I can't get it to quit? Tried deleting what people have suggested. Shame really as other than that I was impressed but no point having a device that drains of battery with no fix.

Why on earth is the priority &quot;small&quot;?

This problem, contrary to what many people think, might not be app specific. I never had snapchat or skype and still have this problem. It drains battery in no time. Nope, this isn't a low priority bug.

I get this same problem with mm-qcamer-daemon draining battery.
I have tried using both ART and dalvik and it happens every few days. The indication is that phone gets very hot and on checking this process has taken 40-60% of battery usage.
So far restarting seems to cure then problem.
Come on Google look into this realistically as too many people are getting the same problems.

I have the same problem on my Nexus 5.
Sometimes the mm-qcamera-daemon causes a wakelock and &quot;sucks&quot; the battery empty in a few hours.

I'm not sure if this info is relevant, but here it is.  Being one to prefer redundant backups, I connected my Nexus 5 to my Linux box and rsync'd the entire thing.  During that, this happened:

$ rsync -a /media/GalaxyNexus .
rsync: read errors mapping &quot;/media/GalaxyNexus/DCIM/Camera/IMG_20140130_211622.jpg&quot;: No data available (61)
rsync: read errors mapping &quot;/media/GalaxyNexus/DCIM/Camera/IMG_20140130_211622.jpg&quot;: No data available (61)
ERROR: GalaxyNexus/DCIM/Camera/IMG_20140130_211622.jpg failed verification -- update discarded.

It does seem interesting that the bad file is a camera image and that the camera is the problem.

I'm trying the factory reset method now.

Same happens to me today, I have unplugged my nexus 5 today from charging and put it in the pocket. After sometime it felt like very warm. When I have checked the phone battery usage it goes down by 15% within 10 minutes and some camera deamon was using all the battery. It happened to me before also. Google do something ASAP.

This has also been happening to me for the last few days, but I bought my phone on launch day and this bug is definitely quite new. Nexus 5, stock ROM, fully updated. Definitely a serious issue. I haven't been able to determine whether specific apps trigger it, but the combination of heavy battery drain and a frequently unusable camera is BAD.

Same issue for me... 
Nexus 5 4.4.2 stock (no root or something like that...)
It happend 4 days ago, I don't know which update of my apps do this... but I'm going crazy! Before this I fell in love with this device.

For now, I remove Skype and wait...

Started with the same issue last weekend on my Nexus 5 (stock, no root) and it happened already twice in 5 days. Had to delete the cache and the icon camara from the main screen and re-start the phone and after that all seemed to go well, but it happened again when I went to charge my phone the next time.

This is REALLY SERIOUS. Please fix it.

Same here. I'm on a business trip accross europe, and my phone keeps dying. Rebooting helped somewhat, but I'm hopping from lounge to lounge trying to get a spot to plug my charger. Is there at least a quick fix that would disable the camera entirely, but stop draining the battery? Couldn't kill mm-qcamera-daemon, sadly.

Try rebooting in safe mode. That way most of the non-stock apps will not work. But battery drain problem typically should not happen. This is a temporary fix though... And one you restart in non safe mode, a lot of your widgets and app settings will have changed from the way you left them..

Google, please make this issue's priority &quot;high&quot; rather than &quot;small.&quot; This is no small issue and is affecting a vast number of users. Great battery life is without a doubt one of the most important components of any mobile device and this issue is destroying battery life. Before this issue developed for me, I used to easily get 16-24 hours of battery life. Now, I only get between 7-9 hours, effectively cutting my battery life in half! Please address this issue as soon as possible. Thank you!

I have had this issue with mm-qcamera-daemon draining the battery for about a week; yesterday in desperation I uninstalled Skype and removed the camera app from my home screen based on some suggestions above. Then rebooted the phone. So far it's behaving and have not seen the dreaded mm-qcamera-daemon again for the last day.

I have Nexus 5 white Kitkat4.4.2. I have never had Snapchat or Yahoo messenger on my phone. 

Please everyone click the STAR at the top of this topic. It's amazing that this issue is still listed as &quot;Small Priority&quot;. That's ridiculous - this issue was making my Nexus5 practically unusable as it kept getting hotter and draining the battery.

Started having this problem, as well. At first, a simple reboot got rid of it temporarily, but now it's back immediately. This bug makes the phone unusable, and it needs to be fixed soon :/

Add me to the list. Nexus 5, stock, started happening about a week ago after owning the phone since it was released. When this occurs, I can't access the camera -- get the same &quot;cannot connect to camera&quot; error that other have reported. Reboot fixes it temporarily but it comes back within 24 hours or so. 

Battery usage shows mm-qcamera-daemon at 49% with &quot;screen&quot; second at 8%. The main recent change is that I encrypted my phone and added a pin lock (reqd to access our corporate email). Not sure if it's coincidence or not, but figured I'd mention it. 

No other camera-related apps installed recently, although I did get an update to BarcodeScanner recently, which someone mentions in an earlier post. I'll try uninstalling that to see if it helps.

Nexus 5, same as others, camera drains 50% of battery without being used, just started happening in the last few days. 


I ran the camera, closed it, and then did power off and on, seems to have fixed it so far.

Yes, my N5 also have this problem, after 4 months of felicity, the last week, battery drain by mm-camera-daemon and camera fail to start. I try Dalvik/ART runtime change, uninstall few apps, but not fix the problem, after 1/2 days the problem returned.
This is a very serious problem, I use this phone for job/free time, but the phone with this problem is unusable.

Yup same issue here, battery draining quickly.

Nexus 5 running KitKat 4.4.2 on ART runtime.

I really think Snapchat has something to do with this. I notice the phone start to heat up as soon as I open Snapchat, at which point I have to reset the phone.

Hope this gets fixed.

Nexus 5 Stock 
Hello all, 

We all seem to have the same problem and there is not any official solution for this. 
Please stop posting &quot;apps&quot; that might trigger the problem, it's not app related its for sure the OS system. It's also not related to any update (app or OS) since this fault has been reported since November (month that Nexus 5 was released). Seems not to be yet solved by Google as I am fully aware after their reply from the support team after my complain.  
Google's solution was to offer me a replacement phone, which I refused since it won't sort any problem and could have incurred on expenses to myself which I was not willing to pay at all.
Meanwhile what seems to sort the problem is a camera block app. Just type camera block on Google Play. Paid version has a handy widget. You basically block all the access to the camera and you will need to unblock access through app when you wish to take a picture. Is far from ideal, but seems to solve the problem while we're wating for a permanent repair from Google. You would probably need also to be clearing camera's data/cache often, and do that before installing app. 

Hope this helps all of you, seems to be the easiest way to go around this major issue affecting so many of us and being neglected by Google.

I agree with #357 as we all know now that this issue is not related to snapchat or whatever because most of us to don't have snapchat or yahoo whatver. In my opinion I had a feeling it could have been Google+ I tried to test it but the thing kept showing up so I have no idea now but I am certain it's not just any app or maybe not an app at all.

White N5 / 32GB / 4.4.2 / unrooted. I almost never use the camera, either with the camera app or in other apps. No video calls, no barcode scanning. Every couple of months, I might use a lightmeter app I have.

Spoke with Google Support about this. The support person indicated they are getting a ton of reports on this, that it is an OS problem that they are working on. Hopefully, this will be patched soon.

Noticed this problem on my unrooted N5 yesterday so found this thread. Went ahead and uninstalled TV Guide (the only new thing I installed recently, a few days ago). Also uninstalled ShopSavvy Barcode Scanner (had it for a long time so don't think it's problematic, but I don't really use it anymore). Rebooted a couple of times and mm-qcamera-daemon is no longer appearing on the battery usage list. Here's hoping my phone is cured.

If I don't use camera at all (either directly or indirectly through an app) the battery usage is fine (been going on for 3.5 days just fine now).

As soon as I use camera in any capacity the drain will begin.

So please ignore reports about Snapchat and/or other apps, I don't have any, the problem is perfectly repeatable just with the camera app.

Nexus 5, latest OS, no hacks of any kind, very few apps installed.

This issue is happening to me as well. It has happened twice in the past 3-4 weeks. So not often for me. But when it does happen it uses about 50% of battery like most others. I go down about 1% every 2 minutes in just stand by when this process is running. 

I have had my Nexus 5 since November 17th. So only a couple weeks after it was released. I never had this issue when I was on 4.4. It only started on 4.4.2. I think when Google developers made camera improvements it introduced this bug of a camera process being stuck on.  

In the screen shots I attached you can see about 2/3rds of the way through where the battery started decreasing at a much quicker rate. Was on battery for about 3 hours and the process was on for about an hour. So that 2/3rds way through the graph where there is a sudden decline is where it started. Restarting the phone killed the process. Also I do not have snapchat or light flow as many others claimed it to be caused by. I think I was using Tumblr, Instagram and Google+ when it started. So I think ANY app with camera permisdions can trigger it. I think it might have been instagram in this scenario for me.

It is not related to the camera app. I have not used the camera over a week. Nevertheless the mm_qcamera_deamon showed up twice in this time and did consume my battery in no time. A restart of my phone solved the problem temporally.
I have a Nexus 5 / 16g / 4.4.2 / rooted.
Don't think this is caused by an app. The only app mentioned in the posts above, installed on my phone is Skype. But I have not used Skype over a month...

Major issue, after about 2-3 weeks using the phone the camera cannot be used (app unable to connect to camera) unless I reboot the device. mm-qcamera-daemon shows huge battery usage and phone is quite warm in the back near the top.

Fix this ASAP.

Nexus 5, 32 GB, stock 4.4.2. Just started happening yesterday evening after a couple of updates came in (Tango was the only one to use the camera). The phone has been fine for the last two months, so weird that something just triggered it now. Anyway, installed Camera Block Free and we'll see how that goes. It found 28 Apps that can use the camera! Some I never realized could. Worth using just to see what's using your camera.

Also noticed this today. mm-qcamera-daemon consumed about 46% of battery. Suspecting Skype, though it hasn't explicitly used the camera (only received a couple of text messages). Once charge, will uninstall and observe.

Now I have a strong feeling that removing the phone from charging while the supply is on causes this... If I turn off the charger and then disconnect the phone then its fine... (this could be a red herring...!)

Update: Note3, stock vzw 4.3; only happened once when I tried the Lenovo camera app from xda, was still happening after uninstall, hasn't come back at all since I fully charged and rebooted. I also suspected &quot;Air view,&quot; so I disabled it after uninstall of Lenovo camera app with no success, have had it on since without issue. Have been using the default camera app without issue since, also.

Been having this issue since yesterday on my Nexus 5. Have uninstalled camera based apps and rebooted but mm-qcamera-daemon is still being used by the battery. 

Concerned that this is a virus or the like.

Nexus 5 (non rooted, 4.4.2) I tried uninstalling every camera related app and features, and then used suggestion from #15 - clear cache and preference of the default camera app and remove the shortcut from the home screen. The issue does not appear for now, then I've installed back my applications (such as Instagram, Skype, etc.) one by one per day to see whether the problem is isolated to a specific app. To this day I've not encountered the mm-qcamera-daemon again, but 
I have yet to try putting back the shortcut.

Throwing this screenshot and my vote to hopefully find a fix in here because it was preventing my Nexus 5 (rooted stock 4.4.2) from charging last night. Reboot did the trick to actually allow my device to charge. For now I'll avoid camera functions, I guess.

Happened again - my more major concern is that when this starts happening - the phone gets hot, both the screen (when screen is turned off), and the back through a case.  This will inevitably reduce the life of the phone itself.  So need a solution asap.  Also can you all please STAR the thread.  It has jumped from 400 to 600 in two days.  If we can get it to 1000+ it will be a top 10 item easily.  Has there been NO response from Google on this whatsoever? Who do we need to petition directly at Google to get this seen?
How about Sundar Pichai? <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SundarPichai/posts" rel="nofollow">https://plus.google.com/+SundarPichai/posts</a>

Add a comment to his latest post:
Hi Sundar, 
Many users are having issues of a camera daemon app draining battery and heating the battery and phone.  Can this please be urgently prioritised for a fix?  At the moment, there has been no response on the forums and the number of users affected has started to increase exponentially. The concern is not only is it an issue with the camera, but it is draining battery as well as potentially causing the phone itself to reduce it's life due to the over heating.
Please see here for further details.:

Same issue here, running Nexus 5 stock unrooted.. Without running any camera application the daemon appears and completely drains the phone.. No instalation of s/w for the last five days.. Problem appeared on the second day of usage of the phone. Ever since then it re appears very 2 days.. This is a major issue not a lower priority..

I think it's a google now issue. It's born from last update. Because of it's integration with the system, Also if you don't use it, it maybe cause malfunction.
we can rate 1 star in gnow application on playstore until it's correct.

Here's a chart I made of number of comments by day on this issue thread, it was reported back in Sept 2013.  But as you can see the comments spiked on Feb 20th. And continue to increase day by day:
Clearly some incompatibility has been introduced since or around the 20th Feb.

TEMPORARY SOLUTION 

Folks, stop posting apps that may cause problem. It's NOT app related, issue is connected to OS.
The only solution at the moment is to install this app: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bettertomorrowapps.camerablockfree" rel="nofollow">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bettertomorrowapps.camerablockfree</a>

This blocks access to camera from apps. Is the only solution before a major update from Google. 
Reboots, hard reset won't fix. Tried everything and the only solution is to prevent access from OS to camera with this app!

I downloaded the camerablock app, and it doesnt seem to work.  It is activated via the blue shiled, but the mm-qcamera-daemon is still there and not releasing even after reboot, removing sim card and all the configuration minus hard reset.

is there something I am missing from the app not working.

I have a Nexus 5 with Android 4.4.2. It happens periodically for me. Restarting my phone indeed fixes it, but I hate seeing 60% of my battery destroyed in just a few minutes. I usually discover the issue too late.

Even I was facing this issue earlier... More than 50% battery drainage by mm-qcamera-daemon...

The solution that worked for me was uninstalling all the apps that directly or indirectly use the camera...

Since then the battery drainage is back to normal....

Although this is a temporary solution, but it works - have been using camera normally since then,no crashing, no issues, normal battery span...

Finally escalated.  Thank you!

Seems to me something or some update changed about 10 days ago for me on stock N5 and started camera app crashing and the dreaded mm-qcamera-daemon battery drain problem. Is there a way to look back at update history?

Thus far appears safe mode appears to prevent problem but is not a viable long term solution.
I'm wondering if it's a problem with g+, google photo auto back up but that pure conjecture.

Aside from short term battery life issue the cycling and extreme heat generated by this problem must inevitably be reducing the life of our devices.

In my case, the issue seemed to be solved after I uninstalled Skype. After I did so, for almost 4 days nothing happened, my phone worked normally, no mm-qcamera-daemon or camera problem. Since I am not 100% sure Skype is to blame, I've just reinstalled it and will see what happens the next 48, 72 hours. I'll get back with additional comments then.

I had this a week or so ago.. Then I installed a new app - Zello and it immediately started up again. Looking at running programs, I found Google Play to have 2 entries.. so I stopped one, reset all apps, and powerdown and recharge.  This is a terrible bug, and I last remember the final kit kat update to be many moons ago, today is 03/03/2014 so this is something new I have never had using any camera app. So Something has snuck in as my version is 4.4.2 KOT49H

I'm in the same boat.  Stock N5 32gb and this issue just started happening a few days ago.

I had no problems for the past few days after uninstalling the most recently installed app (Instagram) and rebooting. Even re-installing didn't re-create the problem, but I think this was due to an app update in the interim period.

The mm-qcamera-daemon problem re-appeared last night following an update of the Barcode Scanner app, and seems to have been resolved so far by a system reboot. As you can see from the attached screenshot, even plugging in the phone to charge barely keeps up with the drain from the mm-qcamera-daemon bug for several hours. However, following a reboot, no more drain.

I had the same issue on my Nexus 5 (stock). mm-qcamera-daemon was draining 50% according to battery stats. The issue started when I tried to take photo from Hangout app, camera could not started. I don't have Snapchat or use Skype for video call from my phone.

Last night I went to Apps and cleared data for camera app. By far, I now see the percentage dropping to 24%. My phone does not get hot when using other apps as it did while qcamera service was running. 

I cant consider or say this is fix, but you can give it a try. Maybe its temporary outage of qcamera.

Re #61 . I have realized that on Note 10.1 2014, I only have unusually high CPU load of mm-qcamera-daemon while using the camera for anything. 
But the CPU usage percentage for that process is usually around 3%, and debug logs report that pictures are taken at normal rate, face detection is done even when I have not asked for it, because it is also used for automatic colour balance.    
But there is no apparent loop visible in the logs. Just very much to do for the process compared to other systems. 

So, the spontantaneous use of mm-qcamera-daemon and drainig of battery seems to be mailnly on Nexus, while unusually high cpu load of mm-qcamera-daemon appears in a few other systems.

Uninstalled Skype (which i haven't logged into in months and months,) uninstalled Amazon play store (somebody suggested,) uninstalled OneDrive (somebody suggested,) and installed the camera freezing app.  
Hopefully this stops this bug until a true fix is found.   THis bug has crippled my phone.

Do not use snapchat or yahoo.  Removing Camera shortcut from home screen does nothing.  Uninstalling Skype does nothing.  Restarting phone does nothing.

This is a major problem.  I have posted it on Google+ and Twitter.  Keep the pressure on and raise the profile of this issue.

Same issue. Tried everything except Factory Reset(dont want to do that). 
The &quot;Disable Camera&quot; app installation also not working for me. Is there anything else I need to do after installing this app and restarting the phone? I need a temporary fix before Android comes up with permanent one.

N5 running Android 4.4.2, picked up yesterday afternoon, and I've noticed the mm-qcamera-daemon taking about 40% battery. Going to leave un-plugged this evening and see how things go. Hopefully this brand-new phone won't be dead by morning. 

Google product engineers, I really hope you're working on a fix for this. I've been wanting an N5 for a few months now and having finally switched to it and then discovering a day later that this is a serious problem is massively irritating. Please don't wait until this leaks onto gizmodo, wired, techcrunch, pcmag, androidcentral, etc., before taking action and putting out an update to rectify this. You must know your loyal users aren't so loyal that they won't start talking to these outlets about this. I'm saying this not to troll, but because I sincerely like Google products and want them to be good, and this is the reality of the marketplace.

Please get this rectified.

+1 I've had issues with the camera not being able to start before, but today was the first time I noticed that my battery didn't seem to last. Particularly because it had a full charge before sleeping and woke up to almost dead battery, and I remember last night the camera failing to initialize. So yeah, this is a pretty serious bug which needs to be addressed!

just further proof that this is NOT app specific.
Funny scenario below which triggers off another camera-daemon hyperdrive.

I get into my car, switch on the bluetooth on the N5, it connects to the car stereo headest via BT.
I abruptly switch off the stereo. Restart the stereo. N5 connect again to Car headet via BT

WHAM!! camera-daemon raises its ugly head and doesnt go away until I reboot

the same problem is happening to me in nexxus 5. i did not have apps like snapchat etc. but it is still happening. Rebooting the phone started the camera but the process is still shown in the batt stats. i think it is a stock rom problem not an app problem...Google fix this quickly please...It drains a lot of battery.. :(((

One other thing to check is if the phone feels hot to touch - both the screen, and the back even through a case. And there you go - the mm-qcamera-daemon is running  Anyone else notice this?  I sincerely hope this will not impact the life of my device?!

I use Nexus 5 for almost 4 months now , i see this issue more frequently popping out only from last month.

Recent days this process kills my battery very fast, i dont know if its a bug with 4.4.2 or with any other app.

i was going through some blogs and some say that it could be because of Clean master app. i will try un installing the app and check this.

But Google please correct this issue and provide us an OS update.

I got my nexus 5 since november and this issue started last weekend. Additionally, when I reboot the phone, my homescreen gets reset and I have to reconfigure all my apps/groups/widgets. 

This issue should be fixed or I go buy an iphone 5s. thanks

I took a screenshot of top Starred defects list yesterday.
Of the top 10 in the list - not a single one has had it's &quot;Star&quot; increased.  This issue however has gone up over 100 in one day alone.  That should tell Google/Android the magnitude of this issue and the number of people it is impacting.  Google need to pull as many resources as they can for this issue.

I've had the same problem with my Nexus 5. I noticed it a few days ago, I tried uninstalling all of my apps that have camera permissions, and it still shows up!! It can drain the battery 70% in just 4 hours!
Again as everyone says, a restart fixes the problem, but we've no idea when or even how the problem starts!!!
Come on google!!!! Get your act together, this is affecting your flagship device!!

I'm also hoping for a fix. I bout my Nexus 5 two days ago and the process is sitting at about 50% of ny bagtery useage' with the next highest being my screen at only 8%. I need my phone to last at least 8-10 hojrs on battery but this camera process kills it from full in about 2-3 hours even when locked. I'm sad to see this issue's been going on since well before the new year :(

Hi,

Same issue here. Having a nexus 5 for about 4 months. Having this issue for about one week. At noon, this process was about 40% of my battery usage.

Hi all, I have tried uninstalling all the apps I recently updated since the problem began, and so far the culprit seems to be Skype as ever since I uninstalled it about 4 days ago the problem never came back (*fingers crossed*)

Same problem

- Samsung T-Mobile Note 3 (SM-N900T)
- Android 4.3
- Kernel 3.4.0-1670611
- Build number JSS15J.N900TUVUBMI7

Note, that as suggested in a thread describing this problem, I have installed Camera Block Free to temporarily mitigate the problem.  Since installing the app, mm-qcamera-daemon has not consumed measurable battery resources.

Same issue on my nexus5 as well  :(  Today i just saw battery usage and i was shocked that &quot; 	mm-qcamera-daemon&quot; was using almost 52% of battery  :/  earlier i was in assumption that, display is taking much battery. So, i was keeping the brightness of screen to low. 

also, sometimes i observed camera application do not open instead it gets crashed. And sometimes phone gets supper hot. 

Google should consider this issue on high priority and fix the issue at earliest.

Thanks, everyone, for reporting about this problem.

We believe we have fixes for the current high CPU reports on N5 due to mm-qcamera-daemon, and they will be included in the next maintenance update. At this point, we don't need more reports of the problem, with some exceptions I'll detail below.

More details:

We've had scattered reports of persistent high CPU usage of mm-qcamera-daemon since our last maintenance update, and based on those, found a number of bugs that were then fixed.

More recently, there's been a significant increase in the frequency of reported problems. These may be related to a recent update to Skype, which seems to access the camera regularly from its background service in some way that triggers this bug (note, we don't currently believe there's a bug in Skype itself). Investigating this, we've identified a few additional fixes that we hope resolve this issue for good.  However, since the high CPU usage is an intermittent problem, we're continuing to test our fixes to verify the problems are gone.

Unfortunately, I can't provide an estimate for when the maintenance update will be ready, due to all the testing we need to do for this and other fixes. Until then, rebooting the phone is the only way to stop the high CPU usage/lack of camera function once it starts.  

Uninstalling Skype may substantially reduce the likelihood of this bug appearing, but I realize Skype is a very important application for many people.  Other camera-using applications may trigger this bug as well, but that's been relatively rare. Most applications also do not access the camera when not in the foreground, so they will only trigger issues when actively used.

I'd also like to note that instances of high CPU use of mm-qcamera-daemon on other devices besides the N5 need to be reported to their manufacturers - while those devices also use a Qualcomm chip for their camera processing (and thus have a mm-qcamera-daemon process), each has differences in their software and issues with them do not necessarily mean the N5 has the same problem, and vice versa.

If you are seeing high CPU use of mm-qcamera-daemon, and you have not used the camera at all, or installed an application like Skype that has a background service that accesses the camera (typically, applications that provide video chat may do this), we would like to know about it. 

Otherwise, for Skype and other typical camera applications, we believe we have fixes identified, and you don't need to add more information to this bug - remember, any note added here will send updates to dozens of people.

Hi Google,

I believe that the built-in Gallery app (because it is tied to the camera app) also triggers the issue.  The last five times where the issue flared up for me was directly correlated with me viewing some pictures inside the Gallery and then exiting.  Even though I was no longer actively using the Gallery app, the battery was still drained until I went to Settings/Apps and force stopped the Gallery app.  The battery drain then stopped immediately.

noblehelium - if the drain stopped when you killed Gallery, it's a different issue.

Please open a new bug with a description, and if possible, system logs and/or an Android bugreport captured when you see high battery use.

I've since uninstalled Skype from my N5, rebooted, and the process still appears. Also... booting in 'Safe Mode' is having no effect whatsoever. My phone is now rendered useless as I don't sit at a desk all day.

davedotnolan - The bug may be triggered by other apps, including the default camera app, but that's been rare in our feedback. Safe mode won't stop all camera use, so the bug may still trigger.  We are checking if other applications may be triggering this issue, but have not seen anything definite yet.

By 'the process still appears', do you mean you see high CPU use, or that mm-qcamera-daemon appears as a running process? The latter is expected, as the daemon is a key part of the camera subsystem. 

If you are seeing high CPU use by that process after a reboot, with no 3rd-party camera-using applications installed, and no use of the built-in camera app or video hangouts after a reboot, we would appreciate more information about it - a system log or Android bugreport would be very useful.

I have not seen that service for two days, and battery drain resolved in my case. I revoked Skype camera permission. Of course I cannot make video calls with Skype, but battery issue had resolved. I need to give it more testing on Vibet and Tango that also uses camera service.

etalv - I'm not sure why you are so convinced that my issue is a different issue...?  The battery drain is caused by mm-qcamera-daemon as shown in the battery usage screen.

Hello.

Modell: Nexus 5, android 4.4.2

Without using camera or photorelated programs. The mm-qcamera-deamon is turned on, listed at the top of battery use list. Fluxuating between 30-70% use of cpu.

I have rebooted the phone, the deamon appares 30min after. Without any camera or photoprogram is started or used.

It started yesterday.

etalv: the original complaint by, myself, was beyond the related &quot;hang&quot; issues, everyone has experienced, that applications can cause in the Qualcomm driver.  The driver itself seems to have been designed in a way that consumes much more resources than it should as it seems to expand and contract linearly depending on the number of cores.  It always consumes around 100% of one core regardless of how powerful a core is and how many there are on a given device.  All of the issues above in the comment history also show up on the Nexus 7 (2013) device as well.  I hope the fixes will be released for that device as well.

Pl do not consider this as a N5 only issue!

I suggest you also test GOOGLE NEXUS 10, I own N5 and N10 BOTH, and have encountered this bug/issue on BOTH devices.

This bug manifests more often on N5, but N10 is not immune to it!

I also agree with #492 , using camera from the locked screen has been a pain even after the 4.4.2 update... battery drain occurs more often than not.

In my case, I found out that the problem was caused by Google Goggles. Since the last update for Google Goggles every time I take a picture Google Goggles starts trying to recognize the picture and the famous &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot; starts. Two days ago I uninstalled Google Goggles and since then no issues even with heavy use of the camera.

Yesterday, I experienced crashing of the camera app o my Nexus 5. I would choose the app and about 5 seconds later it would crash and say &quot;Could not connect to camera&quot;. 

Yesterday, later in the day I noticed my battery being drained quite a bit faster than normal (around 5-10%/hour). I didn't worry about it too much yesterday, but this morning after unplugging my phone I had a 10% drain in 20 minutes. 

Restarting the phone doesn't work for me. Please help!

I have the same problem on the Galaxy S2 with Android 2.3.6!
A few times I wondered about the battery drainage.  Restart solves the problem with my phone, too.
Every time I start the camera app the cpu-time for camera-daemon gets increased by 2-3 seconds. Thats pretty normal, i think.
While mm-qcamera-daemon is wakelocked, the camera crashes, if I want to start it.

I hope thats enough information, I´d appreciate any help!
Thanks!

I faced this issue twice in past 4 weeks.
I am using Nexus 5, 32GB, on 4.4.2

1st time i had used quite some application so i am not sure if that was the issue.

But 2nd time i was hell busy in meeting almost entire afternoon today, so i didn't even unlocked my Nexus for past 2 hours, and after that i noticed that my battery has drained to 30% all thanks to camera-daemon, which was running from past 30 mins as per the battery usage stats.

Please let me know if i could provide more info in form of logs/ or any other means which can help to identify the root cause.

I've had the same problem with my Note 3 on 4.3.  I think it may have been triggered by installing the new version of OneDrive.  I've since installed a camera activation blocking program and it's stopped the problem, but it impacts other programs as well.

Etalv - anyone working on this bug outside of N5 and kitkat?

Nexus 5  Android 4.4.2

First of all I don't have skype.Never used in my life.I tried to delete some apps that could use the camera but don't fix that so I tried a factory reset but after 2 days the problem is still here.Rebooting the device is useless and don't fix the problem.The camera app works good....all works without problems....The only problem is the mm-qcamera daemon at 60/70% that drain down the battery. 

I hope that could help.If you need more info or something tell to me what to do.This is my first android device after years with apple and don't know so much about it...However as start is not so good.......I hope I don't need to go back.

I am experiencing this on my N5 4.2.2 as well.

I dont have Skype or Snapchat installed. I haven't used the camera in the past few days at all or any app which does and it's still happening. This needs to be fixed and pushed out asap as everyone's phones dying in their pockets is totally inexcusable. You guys need to get ahead of this before it gets more coverage and android gets a reputation for battery life measured in minutes.

Nexus 5, 4.4.2

I've had relatively good battery life since getting this phone but this problem started when I rebooted it yesterday.

Warm phone and mm-qcamera-deamon using 54% of battery of 9h 3m 23s.

Wouldn't even charge because the battery power was being used up just as quickly as the USB charge supplied by my laptop.

We realize the power drain is very frustrating, especially with the recent sudden increase in the chance of it happening.

However, high power drain on non-Nexus devices is not something we can help with. If you have a Note, or any other non-Nexus device, you'll have to reach out to your manufacturer.

While the camera daemon process is named the same on many devices that use a Qualcomm chip for camera support, the code in it will be very different, as it is heavily customized for each device. Fixes for one device do not apply to others directly.

Hi Etalv.

One suggestion....

I have been monitoring this thread for sometime now because I am affected with this issue. As you have mentioned this issue could be because of Skype, why can't you inform Skype about this issue and ask them to provide an App update.

Reason why I am looking for Skype update rather than Android OS update is we all know that OS update is not going to be pushed anytime soon. So instead of us waiting for a long time we can at least get a Skype update to fix this issue temp.
 

Please consider this ....

I've experienced this bug on my N5. While I didn't have Skype installed, I believe Instagram triggered the daemon. Phone would be normal after a reboot, and even using the camera, but opening Instagram would *sometimes* cause the camera to lock, and the battery would start to drain.

Uninstalling Skype helped for me. No drain for 5 or 6 days no. Before uninstalling skype it used to occur daily/at least every second day.
Still strange because I've seen it happen when I recieved a WhatsApp message...

aswath : As noted in comment #475, Skype itself doesn't appear to be doing anything wrong. An API call that Skype is making doesn't work as it should do on the Nexus 5.

Changing Skype is therefore not the right thing to do.

Appeared on my nexus 5 seven days ago, uninstall all apps which might use camera include skype, but the problem still there. The &quot;mm-qcamera-daemon&quot; process use 50% of battery, totally unacceptable.

Had same problem yestdrday with my s4. Phone crashed. It rebooted without problem but a few hours later was hit with the dreaded daemon. The usual overheating and battery drain ensued. Also my display turned really bright.  I usually keep it fairly muted. The ominous eye symbol was showing the whole time. Camera wouldn't work. I turned off all camera related functions and removed the camera from home   screen.  Then turned the phone off and on again.  That seemed to sort out all problems.  Till next time. ..

for me no such mm-qcamera thing battery stats but phone gets too hot while playing games.. so my opinion is can we get power saving feature in next update because of this mode we can play games on medium cpu usage so that more battery will be saved 

hope you got it!

Thanks for all the reports. Due to the volume of comments being added to this bug, I'm going to close it to further comments. We know that this is a significant issue for many.

Again, while Skype increases the likelihood of this bug happening, any camera use can trigger it, so even if you remove Skype as a workaround, the drain may recur (but much less often).

If you're seeing battery drain issues on Nexus devices, and there's no mm-qcamera-daemon listed in the battery stats page, please open a new bug. If you're seeing issues on non-Nexus devices, please contact the manufacturer of your device.
