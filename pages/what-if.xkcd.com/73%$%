  <a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/73/"><h1>Lethal Neutrinos</h1></a>
  <p id="question">How close would you have to be to a supernova to get a lethal dose of neutrino radiation?</p>
<p id="attribute">(Overheard in a physics department)</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;lethal dose of neutrino radiation&quot; is a weird one. I had to turn it over in my head a few times after I heard it.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not a physics person, it might not sound odd to you, so here&#39;s a little context for why it&#39;s such a surprising idea:</p>
<p>Neutrinos are ghostly particles that barely interact with the world at all. Look at your hand—there are about a trillion neutrinos from the Sun passing through it every second.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Ok, you can stop looking at your hand now." src="/imgs/a/73/neutrinos_hand.png">
<p>The reason you don&#39;t notice the neutrino flood is that neutrinos hardly interact with ordinary matter at all. On average, out of that massive flood, only one neutrino will &quot;hit&quot; an atom in your body every few years.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">Less often if you&#39;re a child, since you have fewer atoms to be hit. Statistically, my first neutrino interaction probably happened somewhere around age 10.</span></span></p>
<p>In fact, neutrinos are so shadowy that the entire Earth is transparent to them; nearly all of the Sun&#39;s neutrino flood goes straight through it unaffected. To detect neutrinos, people build giant tanks filled with hundreds of tons of material in the hopes that they&#39;ll register the impact of a single solar neutrino.</p>
<p>This means that when a particle accelerator (which produces neutrinos) wants to send a neutrino beam to a detector somewhere else in the world, all it has to do is point the beam at the detector—even if it&#39;s on the other side of the Earth!</p>
<img class="illustration" title="Hey, these ones arrived faster than light! Wait, no." src="/imgs/a/73/neutrinos_cngs.png">
<p>That&#39;s why the phrase &quot;lethal dose of neutrino radiation&quot; sounds weird—it mixes scales in an incongruous way. It&#39;s like the idiom &quot;knock me over with a feather&quot; or the phrase &quot;football stadium filled to the brim with ants&quot;.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[2]</span><span class="refbody">Which would still be less than 1% of the ants in the world.</span></span> If you have a math background, it&#39;s sort of like seeing the expression &quot;ln(x)<sup>e</sup>&quot;—it&#39;s not that, taken literally, it doesn&#39;t make <em>sense</em>, but it&#39;s hard to imagine a situation where it would apply.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[3]</span><span class="refbody">If you want to be mean to first-year calculus students, you can ask them to take the derivative of ln(x)<sup>e</sup> dx. It <em>looks</em> like it should be &quot;1&quot; or something, but it&#39;s not.</span></span></p>
<p>Similarly, it&#39;s so hard to get enough neutrinos to compel even a single one of them to interact with matter, making it hard to picture a scenario in which there&#39;d be enough of them to affect you.</p>
<p>Supernovae<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[4]</span><span class="refbody">&quot;Supernovas&quot; is also fine. &quot;Supernovii&quot; is discouraged.</span></span> provide that scenario. The physicist who mentioned this problem to me told me his rule of thumb for estimating supernova-related numbers: However big you think supernovae are, they&#39;re bigger than that.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a question to give you a sense of scale:</p>
<p>Which of the following would be brighter, in terms of the amount of energy delivered to your retina:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A supernova, seen from as far away as the Sun is from the Earth, or</p></li>
<li><p>The detonation of a hydrogen bomb <em>pressed against your eyeball?</em></p></li>
</ol>
<img class="illustration" title="Can you hurry up and set it off? This is heavy." src="/imgs/a/73/neutrinos_bomb.png">
<p>Applying the physicist rule of thumb suggests that the supernova is brighter. And indeed, it is ... by <em>nine orders of magnitude</em>.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why this is a neat question; supernovae are unimaginably huge and neutrinos are unimaginably insubstantial. At what point do these two unimaginable things cancel out to produce an effect on a human scale?</p>
<p>A paper by radiation expert Andrew Karam provides an answer.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[5]</span><span class="refbody">Karam, P. Andrew. &quot;<a href="http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120313045458/http://www.andrewkaram.com/andy/pdf/HPJ.pdf">Gamma And Neutrino Radiation Dose From Gamma Ray Bursts And Nearby Supernovae.</a>&quot; Health Physics 82, no. 4 (2002): 491-499.</span></span> It explains that during certain supernovae, the collapse of a stellar core into a neutron star, 10<sup>57</sup> neutrinos can be released (one for every proton in the star that collapses to become a neutron).</p>
<p>Karam calculates that the neutrino radiation dose at a distance of one parsec<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[6]</span><span class="refbody">3.262 light-years, or a little less than the distance from here to Alpha Centauri.</span></span> would be around half a nanosievert, or 1/500th the dose from eating a banana.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[7]</span><span class="refbody"><a href="http://xkcd.com/radiation/">xkcd.com/radiation</a></span></span></p>
<p>A fatal radiation dose is about 4 sieverts. Using the inverse-square law, we can calculate the radiation dose:
\[ 0.5\text{ nanosieverts} \times\left ( \frac{1\text{ parsec}}{x}\right )^2 = 5\text{ sieverts} \]
\[ x=0.00001118\text{ parsecs}=2.3\text{ AU} \]
2.3 AU is a little more than the distance between the Sun and Mars.</p>
<p>Core collapse supernovae happen to giant stars, so if you observed a supernova from that distance, you&#39;d probably be inside the outer layers of the star that created it.</p>
<img class="illustration" title="GRB 080319B was the most violent event ever observed—especially for the people who were floating right next to it with surfboards." src="/imgs/a/73/neutrinos_geometry.png">
<p>The idea of neutrino radiation damage reinforces just how big supernovae are. If you observed a supernova from 1 AU away—and you somehow avoided being being incinerated, vaporized, and converted to some type of exotic plasma—even the flood of ghostly neutrinos would be dense enough to kill you.</p>
<p>If it&#39;s going fast enough, a feather can <em>absolutely</em> knock you over.</p>
