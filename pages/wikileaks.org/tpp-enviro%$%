    <p class="j">Today, 15 January 2014, WikiLeaks released the secret draft text for the entire TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) Environment Chapter and the corresponding Chairs' Report. The TPP transnational legal regime would cover 12 countries initially and encompass 40 per cent of global GDP and one-third of world trade. The Environment Chapter has long been sought by journalists and environmental groups. The released text dates from the Chief Negotiators' summit in Salt Lake City, Utah, on 19-24 November 2013. </p>
    <p class="j">The Environment Chapter covers what the Parties propose to be their positions on: environmental issues, including climate change, biodiversity and fishing stocks; and trade and investment in 'environmental' goods and services. It also outlines how to resolve enviromental disputes arising out of the treaty's subsequent implementation. The draft Consolidated Text was prepared by the Chairs of the Environment Working Group, at the request of TPP Ministers at the Brunei round of the negotiations. </p>

        <ul style="border: none;">
            
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">The objectives of this Chapter are to: promote mutually supportive trade and environment policies; promote high levels of environmental protection and effective enforcement of environmental laws; and enhance the capacities of the Parties to address trade-related environmental issues, including through cooperation.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Taking account of their respective national priorities and circumstances, the Parties recognize that enhanced cooperation to protect and conserve the environment and sustainably manage their natural resources brings benefits which can contribute to sustainable development, strengthen their environmental governance and complement the objectives of the TPP.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">The Parties further recognize that it is inappropriate to set or use their environmental laws or other measures in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on trade or investment between the Parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;"><b><a href="#general_commitments" name="general_commitments">Article SS.3: General Commitments</a></b></h3>
        <ul style="border: none;">
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">The Parties recognize the importance of mutually supportive trade and environmental policies and practices to improve environmental protection in the furtherance of sustainable development.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">The Parties recognize the sovereign right of each Party to establish its own levels of domestic environmental protection and its own environmental priorities, and to set, adopt or modify accordingly its environmental laws and policies.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Each Party shall strive to ensure that its environmental laws and policies provide for and encourage high levels of environmental protection and shall strive to continue to improve its respective levels of environmental protection.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">No Party shall fail to effectively enforce its environmental laws through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties, after the date of entry into force of this Agreement.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">The Parties recognize that each Party retains the right to exercise discretion and to make decisions regarding: (a) investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance matters; and (b) the allocation of environmental enforcement resources with respect to other environmental laws determined to have higher priorities. Accordingly, the Parties understand that with respect to the enforcement of environmental laws a Party is in compliance with paragraph 4 where a course of action or inaction reflects a reasonable exercise of such discretion, or results from a <i>bona fide</i> decision regarding the allocation of such resources in accordance with priorities for enforcement of its environmental laws.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the protections afforded in their respective environmental laws. Accordingly, a Party shall not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, such laws in a manner that weakens or reduces the protections afforded in those laws in order to encourage trade or investment between the Parties.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to empower a Party’s authorities to undertake environmental law enforcement activities in the territory of another Party.</li>

        <ul style="border: none;">
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">The Parties recognize that multilateral environmental agreements to which they are party play an important role globally and domestically in protecting the environment and that their respective implementation of these agreements is critical to achieving the environmental objectives of these agreements. Accordingly, each Party affirms its commitment to implement the multilateral environmental agreements to which it is a party.</li>
            
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">The Parties stress the need to enhance mutual supportiveness between trade and environment laws and policies through dialogue between the Parties on trade and environment issues of mutual interest, particularly with respect to negotiations and implementation of relevant multilateral environmental agreements and trade agreements.</li>
            
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">If a Party is found to be in non-compliance with its obligations under a multilateral environmental agreement through applicable compliance procedures under such agreement<a href="#sdfootnote3" name="sdfootnote3top" class="sdfootnoteanc"><sup>3</sup></a>, and such non-compliance is in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties, any other Party whose trade or investment is affected and is party to the same multilateral environmental agreement may request that the Committee be convened to consider the issue by delivering a written request to each national contact point. The Committee shall convene to consider whether the matter could benefit from cooperative activities under this agreement, with a view to facilitating the relevant Party coming into compliance with its obligations under the multilateral environmental agreement.<a href="#sdfootnote4" name="sdfootnote4top" class="sdfootnoteanc"><sup>4</sup></a></li>

            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">The Parties recognize that emissions of certain substances can significantly deplete and otherwise modify the ozone layer in a manner that is likely to result in adverse effects on human health and the environment. To that end, each Party affirms its commitment to take measures to control the production and consumption of, and trade in, such substances by implementing its obligations under the Montreal Protocol of Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, including its amendments.<a href="#sdfootnote5" name="sdfootnote5top" class="sdfootnoteanc"><sup>5</sup></a></li>

            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Each Party shall ensure that interested persons residing in or established in the territory of such Party may request the Party’s competent authorities to investigate alleged violations of its environmental laws, and that the competent authorities shall give such requests due consideration, in accordance with the Party’s law.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Each Party shall ensure that judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative proceedings for the enforcement of its environmental laws are available under its law and are fair, equitable, transparent, and comply with due process of law. Any hearings in such proceedings shall be open to the public, except where the administration of justice otherwise requires, and in accordance with its applicable laws. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Each Party shall ensure that persons with a recognized interest under its law in a particular matter have appropriate access to proceedings referred to in paragraph 3.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Each Party shall provide appropriate sanctions or remedies for violations of its environmental laws for the effective enforcement of those laws. Such sanctions or remedies may include a right to bring an action against the violator directly seeking damages or injunctive relief, or a right to seek governmental action.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Each Party shall ensure that, in the establishment of the sanctions or remedies referred to in paragraph 5, appropriate account is taken of relevant factors. Such factors may include the nature and gravity of the violation, damage to the environment, and any economic benefit the violator has derived from the violation.</li>

             For purposes of this Article, a Party’s MARPOL obligations shall encompass those in 
            existing or future protocols, amendments, annexes, and adjustments to which it is Party; and 
            a Party’s obligations shall be interpreted to reflect, among other things, existing and future reservations, exemptions and exceptions that are applicable to it.</p> 


            <p><b><a href="#sdfootnote12top"  name="sdfootnote12">12</a></b>
             For the purposes of this Article, a subsidy shall be attributable to the Party conferring 
            it, regardless of the flag of the vessel involved or the application of rules of origin to the fish  involved.</p> 
            
            <p><b><a href="#sdfootnote13top"  name="sdfootnote13">13</a></b>
             For the purposes of this agreement, “fishing” means searching for, attracting, 
            locating, catching, taking or harvesting fish or any activity which can reasonably be 
            expected to result in the attracting, locating, catching, taking or harvesting of fish.</p> 
            
            <p><b><a href="#sdfootnote14top" name="sdfootnote14">14</a></b>
             For the purposes of this Article, a fish stock is overfished if the stock is at such a low 
            level that mortality from fishing needs to be restricted to allow the stock to rebuild to a level that produces maximum sustainable yield or alternative reference points based on the best 
            scientific evidence available. Fish stocks that are recognized by the relevant national jurisdictions or regional fisheries management organizations as overfished shall also be 
            considered overfished for the purposes of this paragraph.</p> 
            <p><b><a href="#sdfootnote15top"  name="sdfootnote15">15</a></b>
             The term “fishing vessels” refers to any vessel, ship or other type of boat used for, 
            equipped to be used for, or intended to be used for fishing or fishing related activities as defined in footnote 5.</p> 
            <p><b><a href="#sdfootnote16top"  name="sdfootnote16">16</a></b>
             Sharing information and data on existing fisheries subsidy programs does not 
            prejudge their legal status, effects or nature under the GATT 1994 or the WTO SCM  
            Agreement and is intended to complement WTO data reporting requirements.</p> 
            <p><b><a href="#sdfootnote17top"  name="sdfootnote17">17</a></b>

            apply, the 2001 International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate IUU Fishing, the 2005 Rome Declaration on IUU Fishing, the 2009 Agreement on Port State Measures to 
            Prevent, Deter and Eliminate IUU Fishing, as well as instruments establishing and adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, which are defined as intergovernmental <br/>
            fisheries organizations or arrangements, as appropriate, that have the competence to establish conservation and management measures.</p>
