	<h2 class="posttitle"><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-beta" rel="bookmark">Sublime Text 3 Beta</a></h2>

	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>The first beta of <a href="/3">Sublime Text 3</a> is now available to download for registered users. Some feature highlights are below, followed by our new pricing and upgrade policies, and system compatibility for Sublime Text 3.</p>
<p><b>Symbol Indexing.</b> Sublime Text now scans the files in your project, and builds an index of which files contain which symbols. This backs the new features <i>Goto Definition</i> and <i>Goto Symbol in Project</i>, both of which are available from the Goto menu. <i>Goto Definition</i> takes you to the definition of the symbol under the caret, while <i>Goto Symbol in Project</i> prompts you to select a symbol via fuzzy matching, and then takes you to the definition of that symbol.</p>
<p><b>Pane Management.</b> Working with multiple panes is now more efficient, with commands to create and destroy panes, and quickly move files between panes. You can see the new options under <i>View/Groups</i>, <i>View/Focus Group</i> and <i>View/Move file to Group</i>.</p>
<p><b>Speed.</b> Sublime Text has always had speed as a feature, but version 3 addresses some weak points. Startup time is now virtually immediate, and plugins no longer have the opportunity to bring this down. <i>Replace All</i> performance is also significantly faster.</p>
<p><b>API.</b> Sublime Text now uses Python 3.3 for plugins, and runs them out of process, so any plugins that load native code no longer risk crashing the main Sublime Text process. The API is also fully thread-safe, and provides several callbacks that run asynchronously (e.g., <tt>on_modified_async</tt>). There are also new API functions, including full access to the project data. Sublime Text 2 plugins will require <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/porting_guide.html">porting</a> to work with Sublime Text 3, however in most cases the changes will be small.</p>
<p><b>Selected Changes</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added <i>Goto Definition</i>, and <i>Goto Symbol in Project</i></li>
<li>Significantly improved startup time</li>
<li>Significantly improved <i>Replace All</i> performance</li>
<li>Improved matching algorithm used for <i>Goto Anything</i> and auto-complete accepts transposed characters</li>
<li>UI: Enhanced pane management</li>
<li>UI: Previewing files from the sidebar creates a preview tab</li>
<li>UI: Improved animation in the side bar</li>
<li>Projects: Multiple workspaces can be created for a single project</li>
<li>Projects: When adding folders to the sidebar, symlinks are not followed by default. This can be changed by enabling follow_symlinks in the project</li>
<li>Build Systems: Added &#8217;shell_cmd&#8217;, which supersedes &#8216;cmd&#8217;, with more intuitive syntax</li>
<li>Build Systems: Better PATH handling behavior on OS X when using shell_cmd</li>
<li>Build Systems: &#8216;Make&#8217; build system has an improved error message regex</li>
<li>Build Systems: Syntax file can be specified for the output</li>
<li>Build Systems: Word wrap is enabled by default</li>
<li>Find in Files: Improved handling of binary files</li>
<li>Find in Files: Line numbers are hidden in the output</li>
<li>Find: <i>Find in Selection</i> will no longer be automatically selected</li>
<li>OSX: Improved performance on Retina displays</li>
<li>OSX: 10.7 or later is required</li>
<li>OSX: 64 bit only</li>
<li>OSX: System version of Python is no longer a dependency</li>
<li>OSX: Italic fonts are synthesized when not available in the typeface</li>
<li>Linux: <tt>.deb</tt> files are provided</li>
<li>Linux: Starting from the command line will daemonize the process by default</li>
<li>API: Upgrade from Python 2.6 to Python 3.3</li>
<li>API: Plugins run out-of-process</li>
<li>API: Plugin API is now thread-safe</li>
<li>API: Some API events are now run asynchronously</li>
<li>API: <tt>begin_edit()</tt> / <tt>end_edit()</tt> are no longer accessible</li>
<li>API: Projects are exposed to the API</li>
<li>API: Added <tt>window.settings()</tt> and <tt>window.template_settings()</tt></li>
<li>API: <tt>show_quick_panel()</tt> accepts an <tt>on_highlighted</tt> callback</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Compatibility.</b> Sublime Text 3 should work on all systems that currently run Sublime Text 2, with the exception of OS X 10.6. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to maintain 10.6 compatibility, as there is no C++11 toolchain for OS X 10.6, and Sublime Text 3 makes extensive use of functionality in C++11.</p>
<p><b>Pricing.</b> The price for a Sublime Text license key has increased by $11, from $59 to $70, the first price rise in Sublime Text&#8217;s five year history. All licenses purchased at this new price are valid for Sublime Text 3. Users with a Sublime Text 2 license key can continue using the key with Sublime Text 3 while it&#8217;s in beta. When 3.0 is released, upgrades will be available for $30, or $15 for users who have purchased recently. The cut off date for the reduced upgrade price will be based on the actual date of the 3.0 release.</p>
<p>Sublime Text 3 is currently <a href="/3">available</a> to registered users only. An evaluation version will be available later.</p>

	<p>will it have support for writing Common Lisp? ST2 has a little support, but sometimes the indentation is incorrect, and I stopped using it because of that. </p>
<p>I really like some of the features though.</p>

	<p>Whats the support like for large files? I routinely deal with fairly large files (Up to 1gb) &#8211; and find the handling of files as small as 50mb to be quite painful in ST2, and was one of the reasons I stopped using it Searching and loading is really bad compared to Emacs and Notepad++.</p>
<p>This is my only letdown with ST, and I&#8217;d happily fork over $70+ if this was resolved.</p>

	<p>How well large files are supported is mostly a function of the syntax definition being used. Sublime Text 3 does have performance improvements compared to Sublime Text 2 here, but not significantly so.</p>

<p>And I hope we can disable all animations in v3. Along with overall slower performance, not being able to disable the tab close animation made me stick with v1.</p>

	<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just downloaded and installed it and the first thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that it didn&#8217;t import any of the ST2 settings or packages. I can&#8217;t find any way to import settings and the thought of re-installing all packages puts me off trying it. Are you planning to make it easy to import? Couldn&#8217;t you just ask and import everything that&#8217;s importable so one can carry on working, instead of wasting time setting up the text editor again?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

	<p>Fred: When Sublime Text is indexing your files, it will spawn multiple subprocesses to do the actual work, which will of course make use of your CPU. You can confirm this is what&#8217;s happening by looking in the status bar, where the current indexing progress in displayed.</p>

	<p>First of, I love ST2, and I&#8217;m very much looking forward to all the improvements in ST3.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m especially excited about plugins being run out of process.  Is each plugin going to run in it&#8217;s own process?  Or are all plugins run in one process?</p>
<p>Second I&#8217;d like to echo the sentiments about a switch to Python 3.3.  I expect that even if you supported Python 2.6 it&#8217;d be pretty hard for a plugin author support ST2 and ST3 though I expect the community would come up with compatibility APIs pretty quickly.  A switch to Python 3.3 is not going to make that easier.</p>
<p>It seems like good plugin isolation via processes would make the runtime of the plugin a detail _of_ the plugin as opposed to the editor.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for all the great work on ST2, I look forward to seeing how ST3 progresses.</p>

<p>To me symbol indexing is a great step forward. I&#8217;m still missing symbol argument hints and hints for object methods. SublimeCodeIntel plugin exists for that but it doesn&#8217;t really work (in ST2).</p>

	<p>Fantastic stuff, keep up the very good work! Just one question though: sometimes I have to code in quite memory constrained environments (don&#8217;t even ask). And I&#8217;m wondering if the memory usage of ST3 will be significantly higher than ST2 because every plugin now runs in its own process. Because afaik a process requires a bit of extra memory on every OS + every process will (maybe) load a seperate python interpreter, which wasn&#8217;t the case before. Since I use about 5 plugins regularly I&#8217;m estimating it might give me 120MB+ of active memory usage as opposed to the usual 35MB of ST2. What do you reckon Jon?</p>

	<p>For all those who miss their plugins in ST3 &#8211; you can&#8217;t use Package Control yet, but you can copy your old lovely plugins directly from ST2 folder, and most of them will be working right away. That&#8217;s what I just did.</p>

	<p>It seems like ST3 requires &#8216;GLIBC_2.15&#8242; which is only available in Ubuntu 12 (ok if you&#8217;re handy, you might put GLIBC_2.15 on a lower version).</p>
<p>So out-of-the-box it will only work on Ubuntu 12.04 and higher.</p>

	<p>Clang 3.2 and GCC 4.7 both work perfectly on OS X 10.6. GCC doesn’t support Apple’s blocks and might have worse support for new Objective-C features, but Clang is of course the very compiler Apple uses on newer versions of OS X. There’s only one catch if you want to use Clang with LTO: you need to define DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/llvm/lib; otherwise the linker tries to use the (old) system copy of LLVM. LTO in GCC works out of the box.</p>
<p>You can install Clang or GCC yourself, or you can use Homebrew (llvm &#8211;with-clang; gcc in the homebrew/dupes tap), MacPorts (clang-3.2; gcc47) or Fink (llvm32; gcc47).</p>

<p>One little thing &#8212; I really miss vim&#8217;s internal diff mode (vimdiff). It&#8217;s really handy being able to open two versions of a file side-by-side and be able to edit one pane with all the usual keybindings.<br />
Do you plan to support such mode at some point? Maybe just expose an API for it (opening two files in a single tab), so that one could implement it as a plugin.</p>
