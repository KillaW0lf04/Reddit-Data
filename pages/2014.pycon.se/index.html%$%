              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                 <li><h3>REST APIs for Humans™</h3><p>Nicola Iarocci</p><p>Powered by Flask, Redis, MongoDB and good intentions the Eve REST API framework allows to effortlessly build and deploy highly customizable, fully featured RESTful Web Services. The talk will introduce the project and its community, recount why and how it's being developed, and show the road ahead.</p></li>
                 <li><h3>Helium: Simplified web automation based on Selenium</h3><p>Michael Herrmann</p><p>I present a new library called Helium that wraps around Selenium to reduce web script size by 66% and development effort by (in my tests) 75%. The key to Helium's success is that it allows to identify web elements by user-visible labels instead of HTML IDs, CSS selectors or XPaths.</p>

                 <li><h3>Securing internet services</h3><p>Mikko Ohtamaa</p><p>Internet out there is not exactly a friendly place. In this talk I'll discuss about measurements you can take to protect your site, users and yourself against various attacks.</p>

                 </li>
                 <li><h3>How I built an tag-in system for a gym</h3><p>Johan Lundström</p><p>Armed with only python and no real idea of how to actually do this, I set out on my quest through: The RFID djungel, the vast selection of freely available python modules of varying usefulness, hardware, API design and the perils of shipping and supporting system built entirely in python.</p>
                   Slides: <a href="assets/slides/crosstag.pdf">pdf</a>
                 </li>
                 <li><h3>New Scientific Plotting in Python</h3><p>Jack Parmer</p><p>Matplotlib has wonderfully served the Python community as the cornerstone of scientific graphics. Recently, many additional Python plotting options have surfaced, aimed to make it easier to create graphics that are interactive and web-publishable. This talk will outline these new options using easy-to-follow, IPython notebooks.</p>

                 </li>
                 <li><h3>How do Python programmers use Python?</h3><p>Beatrice Åkerblom</p><p>In an ongoing research project we collect data from running open source Python programs about how these programs are constructed to take advantage of the inherent dynamicity of the language. We are interested in several aspects, including the use of reflective mechanisms, dynamic code evaluation and generation, and unconstrained polymorphism due to dynamic typing.</p>

                 </li>
                <!--li><h3>Data Matching and Big Data Deduping in Python</h3><p>Nikit Saraf</p><p>Until now, using real-world-data is difficult. Apart from encoding and missing value, multiple records which mean the same thing is one of the biggest headache. This talk will demonstrate two tools “Dedupe” and “Dedoop” to handle task of Data Matching and Deduplication in Python  at the scale of millions and billions of records respectively.</p></li-->
                <!--li><h3>Rewrite and Simplify Software with Advanced Features</h3><p>Nicolas Rodriguez</p><p>Python has a lot of advanced features that allows a programmer to express code in an efficient and concise way. I'll like to show how some advanced techniques -with blocks, generators, iterators, functional programming techniques, decorators, ASTs, classes and modules for scoping, python as DSL- can make a huge difference for programmers.</p></li-->
                 <li><h3>Building an API for the University of Oxford</h3><p>David King</p><p>At the University of Oxford we're building an API platform for use in application development both within the University and beyond. What are the benefits of this approach to application development and how are we making it work within a large institution such as Oxford.</p>

                 </li>
                <!--li><h3>the failure of python object serialization: why HPC in python is broken, and how to fix it</h3><p>Michael McKerns</p><p>Parallel and asynchronous computing in python is crippled by pickle's poor object serialization. Dill, a more robust serialization package, strives to serialize all of python.  Dill has been used to enable state persistence and recovery, global caching, and the coordination of distributed parallel calculations across a network of the world's largest computers.</p></li-->
                 <li><h3>Enough Machine Learning to Make Hacker News Readable Again</h3><p>Ned Jackson Lovely</p><p>It's inevitable that online communities will change, and that we'll remember the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately reflect the former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of articles from an online community and winnow out the stuff we feel is unworthy. We'll explore some of the machine learning tools that are just a 'pip install' away, such as scikit-learn and nltk.</p>

                 <li><h3>Pycrastinate: TODO less, DO more.</h3><p>Isaac Bernat</p><p>Tired of TODOs from people who have not touched that code in years? What about FIXMEs? Me too. This is why I wrote pycrastinate in first place, a tool to help you keep that under control (for new and legacy code alike).</p>

                 <li><h3>Deploying enterprise services 60 times a day using Python</h3><p>Robin Kåveland Hansen</p><p>For anyone interested in devops, here is a real-world example of using Python and fabric to do around 60 application deployments across multiple servers every day. Focusing on simplicity and automated testing, we developed a deployment program that's easy for anyone to understand and contribute to.</p>

                 </li>
                 <li><h3>How to write actually Object-oriented Code in Python</h3><p>Per Fagrell</p><p>The multi-paradigm flexibility of Python can bite developers new to Python or object-orientation, since self-restraint and design know-how is needed to keep code style paradigm-consistent. Learn about OO principles like SOLID, DRY and Tell-Don't-Ask and how they apply in  Python for more uniform, testable, and working OO code.</p>

                 <li><h3>Testing with unittest.mock</h3><p>Ana Hristova</p><p>unittest.mock is a Python testing library that allows you to replace parts of your application with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used. This talk will give an overview of the library focusing on the core Mock class and the patch decorator that mock provides.</p>

                 </li>
                 <li><h3>Generators Will Free Your Mind</h3><p>James Powell</p><p>Generators are one of the most notable features of Python, and they are a critical component of Python 3's driving focus on iterability as a core protocol. This talk introduces the basic concepts surrouding generators, generator expressions, and coroutines, then dives into ways that generators can improve our code: not just in terms of performance but also by offering us better ways to model our problems.</p></li>
                 <li><h3>A CPython Eating Its Own Tail</h3><p>James Powell</p><p>This is an expert-level talk that dives into CPython and discusses various ways to embed Python interpreters. It starts with the 'very high level' embedding & the 'pure' embedding, shows a fairly novel 'zero interpreter' embedding using Cython, a few attempts at a ctypes/cffi embedding, and builds to a finish with a source-filter embedding of a Python interpreter into itself.</p></li>
                 <li><h3>Python and biology: a shotgun wedding</h3><p>Karin Lagesen</p><p>New technologies are enabling biologists to do new kinds of analyses. The data from these require new methods for processing, where programming can help a lot. However, learning programming can be challenging. I will show how a little programming can go a long way, and give some tips for beginners.</p></li>
                <!--li><h3>No programming education - No future python programmers</h3><p>Marcus Weiderstål</p><p>My talk will focus on Python, programming education and the swedish school system. How do we get them to work together and how will the future be? Everyone interested in the future, the educational system or how you could learn a new programming language should be the intended audience.</p></li-->

            <p>
              The community around Python has grown a lot in the last years. In Stockholm alone the Python
              user group has over 800 members and counting. Some of us have been talking about arranging a
              conference for a while now and we are now happy to invite you to the first national PyCon in
              Sweden ever.
            </p>
