I didn’t think twice about the news. To me, it was just another marketing gimmick, like so many corporate-sponsored hackathons before it, to trick otherwise sane developers into working for free—with copious amounts of junk food and caffeine and the lure of dubious prizes—to develop apps on top of APIs and platforms they otherwise wouldn’t bother with.</p><p name="af2f" class="post-p paragraph--last"><a id="af2f"></a>Corporate-sponsored hackathons are all-win for the sponsoring company. They get a big influx of fresh ideas, and developers working themselves to illness (not quite death, but a diet of soda and pizza, plus sleep deprivation and being sedentary for long periods is the definition of unhealthy), just to meet a crazy deadline. In return, the company puts up a couple prizes which is far <em class="post-pEm">far</em> less than what it would cost them to get the same result in-house, paying developers fair wages, assuming they even have developers of the caliber that their hackathon might attract. On top of it all, it’s also a recruiting event for the company.</p></div></div></section><section name="5d77"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="82c5" class="post-p paragraph--first"><a id="82c5"></a>But a couple weeks after the initial announcement, Matt Thompson—a respected iOS developer and mobile lead at Heroku, a Salesforce acquisition—wrote <a target="_blank" href="http://mattt.me/2013/dreamforce-hackathon/" class="post-anchor post-pAnchor" rel="nofollow">a blog post</a> about why people should sign up for this big hackathon. He laid out his arguments about developing for the enterprise, reasons I was more than familiar with since my first startup developed enterprise software and I have seen first hand just how bad the software is that most people have to use to do their jobs.</p><p name="4660" class="post-p"><a id="4660"></a>Matt also mentioned entering the hackathon was now free. This should actually have set off alarm bells, because anyone who was anywhere around the Moscone Center during Dreamforce, can see just how much money is poured into this conference. Why would they charge developers $99 for a chance to add value to Salesforce! To their credit, I believe developers who did pay the $99 to enter were reimbursed.</p><p name="bc4b" class="post-p"><a id="bc4b"></a>I started to mull it over and pinged my partner Ben about doing this hackathon together. Ben, like me, was quite skeptical about entering a corporate hackathon. The lure of the prizes at these events is never worth the effort one has to put into these projects. At traditional developer-run hackathons, you join because it’s a chance to work with new technologies in a setting where you can collaborate with others, and it’s damned exciting to build something and to do it under severe constraints. Developers <em class="post-pEm">love</em> a good challenge. Winning is much more about the pride of having the best “hack” that could be developed in such a short amount of time—the prizes were just icing.</p><p name="4d6f" class="post-p"><a id="4d6f"></a>At corporate-sponsored hackathons, though, the goal is to have developers build on top of the sponsor’s platform and use their APIs. After all, having a platform is useless if there are no developers building for it. Enterprise software has a knack for having terrible usability and their APIs are rarely better. It’s difficult to attract good developers to build on top of shoddy platforms. But then companies figured out that they could get these developers under the guise of a hackathon. They hijacked the goodwill of developers who just want an excuse to build cool stuff.</p><p name="2bc0" class="post-p"><a id="2bc0"></a>But I was swayed by Matt’s blog post:</p><blockquote name="85be" class="post-blockquote"><a id="85be"></a>Honestly, if you’re reading this, your chances are probably pretty darn good. If I weren’t an employee (and thus legally prevented from entering), I’d be all over this.</blockquote><p name="7e55" class="post-p paragraph--last"><a id="7e55"></a>Ben and I figured we can make a nice side project out it, and I had been looking to dive back into iOS anyway—having a deadline will give us some good motivation.</p></div></div></section><section name="5b12"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="b81c" class="post-p paragraph--first"><a id="b81c"></a>After nearly two weeks of evenings spent coding and designing, and one all-nighter, we submitted <a target="_blank" href="http://salesrun.co/" class="post-anchor post-pAnchor" rel="nofollow">our app</a> according to Salesforce’s extremely long and meticulous <a target="_blank" href="http://salesforce1million.challengepost.com/rules" class="post-anchor post-pAnchor" rel="nofollow">Rules</a>. Rules which include (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote name="83ba" class="post-blockquote"><a id="83ba"></a>The application you or your team submits must:<br>• be a mobile application<br>• use the Salesforce Platform<br>• <strong class="post-blockquoteStrong">have been developed solely as part of this Hackathon</strong><br>• be a completed working application at time of submission<br>• be functional and comply with these Official Rules</blockquote><p name="fd48" class="post-p"><a id="fd48"></a>We went by the Developer Zone at Dreamforce a half hour after the 6pm deadline to see if we could see the judging, but event staff were shutting things down and starting to kick people out! We thought that was weird, there wasn’t even anywhere to see all the submissions. At typical hackathons, this is usually the most exciting period. You get a chance to see what everyone else came up with, and hear what the judges think of the submissions, and get feedback about your app from judges and other participants.</p><blockquote name="6965" class="post-pullquote pullquote"><a id="6965"></a>At the Salesforce Hackathon, the picking of the five finalists was done completely in secret, with no clue about who did the judging, or what was evaluated.</blockquote><p name="ddf7" class="post-p"><a id="ddf7"></a>Finally, later that evening, all the submissions were up on ChallengePost, the company that handled the submissions for the hackathon, and Ben and I started checking out the competition according to Salesforce’s judging criteria:</p><blockquote name="e32b" class="post-blockquote"><a id="e32b"></a><strong class="post-blockquoteStrong">Innovation: </strong>Is it an amazing new scenario?</blockquote><blockquote name="547f" class="post-blockquote"><a id="547f"></a><strong class="post-blockquoteStrong">Business Value: </strong>Does the application create value? Does it save money, create opportunity, connect customers, partners, and employees?</blockquote><blockquote name="ef25" class="post-blockquote"><a id="ef25"></a><strong class="post-blockquoteStrong">User Experience: </strong>Does the app have a user interface that is gorgeous, easy to use, and fast?</blockquote><blockquote name="bd40" class="post-blockquote"><a id="bd40"></a><strong class="post-blockquoteStrong">Use of Salesforce Platform: </strong>Does the application take advantage of the features and capabilities of the Salesforce Platform?</blockquote><p name="380a" class="post-p"><a id="380a"></a>Some apps were real contenders, but many apps did not appear to meet all the judging criteria. Then there were those that clearly did not even adhere to the rules, because a couple entries looked like companies who just repackaged their existing product for the hackathon! We hoped the judges, whoever they were, would see through those. The rules clearly state:</p><blockquote name="c3fc" class="post-blockquote"><a id="c3fc"></a>Participants may begin forming their teams and working on their entry (each, an “Entry” and, together, the “Entries”) as early as October 25, 2013. Each Entry shall consist of a mobile application with a link to the working source code, the application login credential, a written description and a brief demo video.</blockquote><p name="85fc" class="post-p paragraph--last"><a id="85fc"></a>(They actually required the working source code to be zipped up and uploaded. A requirement included being able to compile and run your app.)</p></div></div></section><section name="7b20"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="e0e2" class="post-p paragraph--first"><a id="e0e2"></a>The next morning I saw a bland standard rejection email, which was sent just past 3am that night, specifically stating no judging feedback will be given. I quickly checked Testflight and our app data to see if it had been run. While Salesforce does say not all apps will be run, I thought we would at least pass the video stage and have someone actually check out our app, but the Testflight email with our build wasn’t even opened. (Not having your app run later turned out to be a wide-spread <a target="_blank" href="http://salesforce1million.challengepost.com/forum_topics/2644" class="post-anchor post-pAnchor" rel="nofollow">phenomenon</a>, and some reported that their video was never even watched. We can’t tell if our video was viewed by judges or not.)</p><p name="602b" class="post-p paragraph--last"><a id="602b"></a>Having spent collectively over 150 hours working on something, giving up nights and weekends, and not even have someone actually look at our app left a distinctively sour taste, but hey, what the hell. Judges at hackathons can be of questionable quality and it’s not a rigorous competition. I was satisfied knowing we made a good effort and I was proud of what we achieved in two weeks.</p></div></div></section><section name="639e"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="62c6" class="post-p paragraph--first"><a id="62c6"></a>I tried to see who the finalists were, but all the submissions on ChallengePost had completely disappeared overnight. Strange. I followed along on Twitter as the winners were announced, and was dismayed to see a <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/preillyme/status/403679005489905664" class="post-anchor post-pAnchor" rel="nofollow">tweet</a> that said the winner was a former Salesforce employee. Could this be true?</p><p name="25c6" class="post-p"><a id="25c6"></a>While Salesforce rules say employees as of Sep 1, 2013 could not enter the hackathon, it appears people who were employed not just as recently as this year, but who is “<em class="post-pEm">Formerly an engineer at Salesforce for </em><strong class="post-pStrong"><em class="post-pEm">9 </em></strong><em class="post-pEm">years.

A “tool that lets you easily create and edit [Salesforce]<em class="post-pEm"> </em>reports on a mobile device.”</p><p name="d255" class="post-p"><a id="d255"></a>I think it’s a bit of stretch that <a target="_blank" href="http://salesforce1million.challengepost.com/submissions/18475-upshot" class="post-anchor post-pAnchor" rel="nofollow">a reporting tool</a><em class="post-pEm"> </em>was the <em class="post-pEm">most </em>innovative submission, but most “gorgeous”? C’mon. Within enterprise there is a ton of favoritism of the “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours” kind. (It’s no coincidence the iPad giveaways at industry conferences always land in the hands of a key contact at a customer or partner. As a company spending marketing dollars, you want to get your money’s worth!) It’s naive to think that Salesforce wouldn’t give a leg up to favored developer partners.</p><p name="5a3b" class="post-p paragraph--last"><a id="5a3b"></a>Ben and I were disappointed that this hackathon was no different, but what makes it even more egregious and outright wrong, is that the winners had <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/Salesforce-com-Integration-Analytics/events/136920332/" class="post-anchor post-pAnchor" rel="nofollow">demoed their app at Meetup</a> on Oct 8, well before the hackathon even started, which is in violation of the rules.</p></div></div></section><section name="baa0"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="947f" class="post-p paragraph--first"><a id="947f"></a>If Salesforce doesn’t adhere to their own rules, there’s not much that can be done.

Compare this to <em class="post-pEm">every</em> other hackathon where the submitted projects are up on the website, people can check out other people’s demos, learn from others, and see for themselves what was good. It’s a place for developers to showcase what they built.</p><p name="d7ec" class="post-p"><a id="d7ec"></a>There were 149 submissions, which is not such a huge number that Salesforce could not handle more hands-on judging at such a hyped-up hackathon, especially considering how many employees worked this event.

Kind of. You can tell it’s not even done very well, because in the <a target="_blank" href="http://salesforce1million.challengepost.com/submissions/18475-upshot" class="post-anchor post-pAnchor" rel="nofollow">video</a> the graph is still wider than the width of the phone screen, and they had to pinch the screen to see all of it.

In return, the company puts up a couple prizes which is far far less than what it would cost them to get the same result in-house, paying developers fair wages, assuming they even have developers of the caliber that their hackathon might attract.
