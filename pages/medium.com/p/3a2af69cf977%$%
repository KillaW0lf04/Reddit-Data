When I renewed my license a few months ago the DMV gave me the option of using my recent license photo or take a new one. I opted to use the old photo. It’s a black and white photo as far as I can tell, but according to Matt Barrie the background of my driver’s license photo appeared to be “brown.” I think it’s a rather ridiculous reason for why they rejected my ID, it clearly does not look like a brown background photo and is in fact my valid New York ID issued from the state. Regardless, they should have told me this immediately instead of giving me the runaround for days and holding up my payment. They also should have done this verification process before I began working on the project and before I waited for 2 weeks for the first wire. They also never requested that I do a keycode verification where I hold a sign using the unique keycode they give me and holding up my ID. I am displeased with their handling of this, but thankful that my client is dependable and professional and has opted to continue this project off of freelancer.com.</em></strong></p><p name="7b6f" class="post-p"><a id="7b6f"></a><strong class="post-pStrong"><em class="post-pEm">I regret that these are the actions I had to take in order to get freelancer.com to clarify why they were holding my payment and rejecting my ID.

One extremely bad circumstance after another, and everything I worked for the previous 8 years was taken away.</p><p name="d057" class="post-p"><a id="d057"></a>You can plan on surviving one or two disasters, but it gets exponentially difficult to deal with multiple catastrophes that occur one after another for two years straight.</p><p name="4532" class="post-p"><a id="4532"></a>Two years ago I had multiple mortgage commitments to close on what seemed to be our dream house.</p><p name="d21e" class="post-p"><a id="d21e"></a>The dream house became a nightmare when we realized the builder was a con artist. He couldn&#39;t get a clear title and our mortgage commitments expired. We began hearing multiple horror stories about what he had done to other buyers. It suddenly made sense why the previous owners had moved so fast after putting so much money down.</p><p name="991c" class="post-p"><a id="991c"></a>The stress mounted while we tried to figure out how to save the house. The stress was too much for my wife and as a result she began getting sick. The constant stress caused her to experience menorrhagia. She had to get her first blood transfusion nine months ago, or she would have bled to death.</p><p name="447c" class="post-p"><a id="447c"></a>Because of all this, I was unable to dedicate enough time to my clients. I had to start declining most offers because I could not split my time between the problems I was dealing with and meeting the deadlines my clients required.</p><p name="c6d4" class="post-p"><a id="c6d4"></a>The builder ended up stealing our down payment and evicted us from the house.</p><p name="46e4" class="post-p"><a id="46e4"></a>It was the middle of January, we ran out of oil for heat, and we were up for two days packing. We managed to get one and a half truck loads before the sheriff arrived. When the sheriff came, our cat panicked and ran off. The sheriff moved our belongings to the porch. We came back the next day to get more of our belongings, and before we were even finished loading the truck, the builders friends were parked waiting for us to leave, so they could go pick through whatever we couldn&#39;t load.</p><p name="a206" class="post-p"><a id="a206"></a>After we left, the builder moved an excavator in the driveway to ensure we would not be able to get the rest of our belongings.</p><p name="d8a9" class="post-p"><a id="d8a9"></a>We still went back to look for our missing cat, but I was unable to search for long because they were waiting for me. My attorney already advised me these were violent people and to use caution if I planned on going back to the house for anything. We had to leave again in a hurry.</p><p name="5d60" class="post-p"><a id="5d60"></a>It is hard to describe the rage you feel inside, when someone takes everything from you, including part of your family.</p><p name="2ba6" class="post-p"><a id="2ba6"></a>My wife and I had to spend a night in our car in sub zero degree weather because things happened too fast for us to make moving arrangements.</p><p name="691a" class="post-p"><a id="691a"></a>My wife’s aunt offered to let us stay with them until we could find a place. We had to sell the things we managed to get into storage, and it was just enough to get us into an apartment before we overstayed our welcome at her relatives.</p><p name="4543" class="post-p"><a id="4543"></a>A month later my wife was in the hospital again and needed another blood transfusion.</p><p name="f0b0" class="post-p"><a id="f0b0"></a>This whole ordeal was physically and mentally exhausting, but I was determined to get our life back.</p><p name="fa53" class="post-p"><a id="fa53"></a><em class="post-pEm">Edited for clarification: I had reservations about including the real estate situation in this post. I felt that the context was important, but I also didn&#39;t want most of the post to be about it, and I didn&#39;t want it to come across as a pity party. I summarized a lot of the details. To clear things up, it was a long drawn out series of events, it wasn&#39;t something that happened in the span of a few weeks, it happened over the course of two years. I spent months going back and forth in courts and ultimately lost. There is still a lot more to this, but the goal of this post is to warn people about freelancer.com and to put the pressure on them to resolve my account issue.</em></p><h2 name="c43d" class="post-h2"><a id="c43d"></a>Getting back up</h2><p name="0eba" class="post-p"><a id="0eba"></a>Today I am back in a position to work full time.</p><p name="3ac7" class="post-p"><a id="3ac7"></a>I started networking through freelancer sites, and continue to network through forums and social networks.</p><p name="0332" class="post-p"><a id="0332"></a>I found a great client on freelancer.com. It was a challenge since I was competing with many others who were willing to work for far less than I was. I didn&#39;t let this deter me though. I bid what was worth it to me to do projects, and sent proposals explaining why I was the right choice for the project.</p><p name="5283" class="post-p"><a id="5283"></a>I had lost the first dozen bids I submitted. I was short listed for about 4, and ultimately awarded one. It was the biggest project I had bid on, and the largest bid.</p><h2 name="37b4" class="post-h2"><a id="37b4"></a>Pertinacity</h2><p name="8348" class="post-p"><a id="8348"></a>Freelancer.com immediately charged $ 1,000.00 when the project was awarded to me. This consumed almost half of the first milestone.</p><p name="1797" class="post-p"><a id="1797"></a>Because I already chose to invest my time in the freelancer.com project, that also meant I would have to endure their 2 week hold for the first payment. Other sites do not have these rigid wait periods, and I certainly didn&#39;t have the time to spare, but I liked the project and the client, so I committed to it despite it not being the fastest way to generate income, but it did seem the most reliable.</p><p name="11bf" class="post-p"><a id="11bf"></a>There is no such thing as multi-tasking when it comes to programming. You must focus 100% on the project at hand if you want to be effective.</p><p name="b2d4" class="post-p"><a id="b2d4"></a>My financial obligations would have to be put off until I received the first wire. This meant more pressure for the next two weeks.</p><p name="7f5c" class="post-p"><a id="7f5c"></a>I put it out of my mind the best I could and focused on completing the project. I pulled all nighters and worked 18 hour days. By the time the first wire was due to be sent, the project was 90% completed.</p><p name="d0ff" class="post-p"><a id="d0ff"></a>The next day I noticed the wire had not arrived. I checked with freelancer.com and they then informed me that their wires take 3 to 5 business days. I have never seen a wire transfer take this long, and I have received wire transfers from all over. This means that I will now be even later with payments on the dates I promised to pay.</p><p name="0d21" class="post-p"><a id="0d21"></a>It’s getting a lot harder to deal with these problems. I inform my client that I have not been paid anything by freelancer.com yet, and he offers to send another milestone to ensure that all my bills are covered when the next wire is sent. The deadline to lodge a request for the next wire is less than 24 hours and he sent the milestone payment while he was on the phone with me. I immediately submitted the next wire request, thanked my client, and got back to work.</p><h2 name="5ac7" class="post-h2"><a id="5ac7"></a>Nails in my coffin</h2><p name="9a10" class="post-p"><a id="9a10"></a>The relief from the second milestone payment was short-lived. The following morning I received notification through email that my account is now limited, and freelancer.com is demanding further information to verify my identity.</p><p name="e95e" class="post-p"><a id="e95e"></a>I immediately take a photo of my New York driver’s license as requested for the Government issued identification.</p><p name="f0f2" class="post-p"><a id="f0f2"></a>I also took a photo of the letterhead of my electric bill, as requested for the proof of residential address.</p><p name="f223" class="post-p"><a id="f223"></a>Later that evening, I get an email that both documents were rejected.</p><p name="b47b" class="post-p"><a id="b47b"></a>The drivers license is rejected because:</p><blockquote name="fd9e" class="post-blockquote"><a id="fd9e"></a>Please submit another form of id other than your passport.</blockquote><p name="6491" class="post-p"><a id="6491"></a><strong class="post-pStrong">I didn&#39;t submit a passport…</strong></p><p name="98a8" class="post-p"><a id="98a8"></a>The utility bill is rejected because:</p><blockquote name="8bb2" class="post-blockquote"><a id="8bb2"></a>Please submit the document in its entirety, ensuring the edges are visible.</blockquote><p name="7702" class="post-p"><a id="7702"></a><strong class="post-pStrong">Reasonable enough…</strong></p><p name="ccb5" class="post-p"><a id="ccb5"></a>I take and submit a new photo of my id, and then I submitted a bank statement scan I already had available.</p><p name="0f16" class="post-p"><a id="0f16"></a>The following evening I am notified that the bank statement is accepted, but again they rejected the drivers license.
