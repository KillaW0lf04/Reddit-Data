      <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio - When you &ldquo;lose yourself&rdquo; inside the  world of a fictional character while reading a story, you may actually end up  changing your own behavior and thoughts to match that of the character, a new  study suggests.</p>
      <p>Researchers at Ohio State University examined what  happened to people who, while reading a fictional story, found themselves  feeling the emotions, thoughts, beliefs and internal responses of one of the  characters as if they were their own - a phenomenon the researchers call  &ldquo;experience-taking.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>They found that, in the right situations, experience-taking  may lead to real changes, if only temporary, in the lives of readers.</p>

<p>In one experiment, for example, the researchers found  that people who strongly identified with a fictional character who overcame  obstacles to vote were significantly more likely to vote in a real election  several days later.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Experience-taking can be a powerful way to change our  behavior and thoughts in meaningful and beneficial ways,&rdquo; said <a href="http://faculty.psy.ohio-state.edu/libby/">Lisa Libby</a>,  co-author of the study and assistant professor of <a href="http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/">psychology at Ohio State  University</a>.</p>
      <p>There are many ways experience-taking can affect  readers.</p>
      <p>In another experiment, people who went through this  experience-taking process while reading about a character who was revealed to  be of a different race or sexual orientation showed more favorable attitudes  toward the other group and were less likely to stereotype.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Experience-taking changes us by allowing us to merge  our own lives with those of the characters we read about, which can lead to  good outcomes,&rdquo; said Geoff Kaufman, who led the study as a graduate student at  Ohio State. He is now a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.tiltfactor.org/the-lab">Tiltfactor Laboratory</a> at  <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a>.</p>
      <p>Their findings appear online in the <em><a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/psp/index.aspx">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</a></em> and will be published  in a future print edition.</p>
      <p>Experience-taking doesn&rsquo;t happen all the time. It only  occurs when people are able, in a sense, to forget about themselves and their  own self-concept and self-identity while reading, Kaufman said. In one  experiment, for example, the researchers found that most college students were  unable to undergo experience-taking if they were reading in a cubicle with a  mirror.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The more you&rsquo;re reminded of your own personal identity,  the less likely you&rsquo;ll be able to take on a character&rsquo;s identity,&rdquo; Kaufman  said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You have to be able to take yourself out of the picture,  and really lose yourself in the book in order to have this authentic experience  of taking on a character&rsquo;s identity.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>In the voting study, 82 undergraduates who were  registered and eligible to vote were assigned to read one of four versions of a  short story about a student enduring several obstacles on the morning of  Election Day (such as car problems, rain, long lines) before ultimately  entering the booth to cast a vote. This experiment took place several days  before the 2008 November presidential election.</p>
      <p>Some versions were written in first person (&ldquo;I entered  the voting booth) while some were written in third person (&ldquo;Paul entered the  voting booth&rdquo;). In addition, some versions featured a student who attended the  same university as the participants, while in other versions, the protagonist  in the story attended a different university.</p>
      <p>After reading the story, the participants completed a questionnaire  that measured their level of experience-taking - how much they adopted the  perspective of the character in the story. For example, they were asked to rate  how much they agreed with statements like &ldquo;I found myself feeling what the  character in the story was feeling&rdquo; and &ldquo;I felt I could get inside the  character&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The results showed that participants who read a story  told in first-person, about a student at their own university, had the highest  level of experience-taking. And a full 65 percent of these participants  reported they voted on Election Day, when they were asked later.</p>
      <p>In comparison, only 29 percent of the participants voted  if they read the first-person story about a student from a different  university.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;When you share a group membership with a character from  a story told in first-person voice, you&rsquo;re much more likely to feel like you&rsquo;re  experiencing his or her life events,&rdquo; Libby said. &ldquo;And when you undergo this  experience-taking, it can affect your behavior for days afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>While people are more likely to lose themselves in a  character who is similar to themselves, what happens if they don&rsquo;t learn that a  character is not similar until later in a story?</p>
      <p>In one experiment, 70 male, heterosexual college  students read a story about a day in the life of another student. There were  three versions - one in which the character was revealed to be gay early in the  story, one in which the student was identified as gay late in the story, and  one in which the character was heterosexual.</p>

<p>Results showed that the students who read the story  where the character was identified as gay late in the narrative reported higher  levels of experience-taking than did those who read the story where the  character&rsquo;s homosexuality was announced early.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;If participants knew early on that the character was  not like them - that he was gay - that prevented them from really experience-taking,&rdquo;  Libby said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;But if they learned late about the character&rsquo;s  homosexuality, they were just as likely to lose themselves in the character as  were the people who read about a heterosexual student.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Even more importantly, the version of the story  participants read affected how they thought about gays.</p>
      <p>Those who read the gay-late narrative reported  significantly more favorable attitudes toward homosexuals after reading the  story than did readers of both the gay-early narrative and the heterosexual  narrative.</p>
      <p>Those who read the gay-late narrative also relied less  on stereotypes of homosexuals - they rated the gay character as less feminine and  less emotional than did the readers of the gay-early story.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;If people identified with the character before they  knew he was gay, if they went through experience-taking, they had more positive  views - the readers accepted that this character was like them,&rdquo; Kaufman said.</p>
      <p>Similar results were found in a story where white students  read about a black student, who was identified as black early or late in the  story.</p>
      <p>Libby said experience-taking is different from  perspective-taking, where people try to understand what another person is going  though in a particular situation - but without losing sight of their own  identity.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Experience-taking is much more immersive - you&rsquo;ve  replaced yourself with the other,&rdquo; she said.</p>
      <p>The key is that experience-taking is spontaneous - you  don&rsquo;t have to direct people to do it, but it happens naturally under the right  circumstance.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Experience-taking can be very powerful because people  don&rsquo;t even realize it is happening to them. It is an unconscious process,&rdquo;  Libby said.</p>
      <p>The study was funded by a <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> <a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">Graduate Research Fellowship</a> to Kaufman.</p>
