<p><iframe width="585" height="329" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Va3DONfSdto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><strong>by Jane Sevier</strong><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Gifted children are likely to be the next generation&#8217;s innovators and leaders—yet the exceptionally smart are often invisible in the classroom, lacking the curricula, teacher input and external motivation to reach full potential.</p>
<p>This conclusion comes as the result of the largest scientific study of the profoundly gifted to date, a 30-year study conducted by researchers at Vanderbilt University’s <a href="http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/departments/psych" target="_blank">Peabody College</a> of education and human development.</p>
<p><a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/publications/david-lubinski" target="_blank">David Lubinski</a>, professor of psychology and human development at Peabody, led the study, which tracked 300 gifted children from age 13 until age 38, logging their accomplishments in academia, business, culture, health care, science and technology. The results were recently published in a paper titled “Who Rises to the Top? Early Indicators,” in <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/Kell-Lubinski-Benbow-20132.pdf"><em>Psychological Science</em></a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_189649" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 213px"><a href="http://news.vanderbilt.edu/files/Lubinski_David_preferred.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-189649 " title="Lubinski_David_preferred" src="http://news.vanderbilt.edu/files/Lubinski_David_preferred.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="313" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">David Lubinski (Vanderbilt University)</p></div>
<p>“Gifted children are a precious human-capital resource,” said Lubinski, who has spent four decades studying talented individuals to correlate exceptional early SAT scores with achievement later in life. &#8220;This population represents future creators of modern culture and leaders in business, health care, law, the professoriate and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Our study provides new insight into the potential of these children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peabody collaborators on the study were <a href="http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/bio/camilla-benbow">Camilla P. Benbow</a>, Patricia and Rodes Hart Dean of Education and Human Development; and Harrison Kell, visiting postdoctoral research fellow in the <a href="http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/departments/psych">Department of Psychology and Human Development</a>.</p>
<p>The children for the study were selected using above-level testing procedures, namely SAT verbal or math scores achieved at age 13 or younger that placed them in the top .01 percent in reasoning ability. The children&#8217;s accomplishments were impressive.</p>
<p>Of the 320 participants, 203 went on to earn master’s degrees and above. Of these, 142 (about 44 percent) also earned doctoral degrees—markedly higher than the general population (around 2 percent). The majority of the children went on to pursue careers of note, becoming senior leaders at Fortune 500 companies, prolific software engineers, physicians, attorneys, and leaders in public policy, including one who advised the President of the United States on national policy issues.</p>
<p>Despite their remarkable success, researchers concluded that the profoundly gifted students had experienced roadblocks along the way that at times prevented them from achieving their full potential. Typical school settings were often unable to accommodate the rapid rate at which they learned and digested complex material. When students entered elementary and high school classrooms on day one having already mastered the course material, teachers often shifted focus away from them to those struggling with the coursework. This resulted in missed learning opportunities, frustration and underachievement, particularly for the exceptionally talented, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>“There’s this idea that gifted students don’t really need any help,” Kell said. “This study shows that’s not the case. These people with very high IQs—what some have called the ‘scary smart’—will do well in regular classrooms, but they still won’t meet their full potential unless they’re given access to accelerated coursework, AP classes and educational programs that place talented students with their intellectual peers like Peabody&#8217;s <a href="http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/people/pty">Programs for Talented Youth</a>.”</p>
<p>While there are programs in place to help those with learning disabilities, there are none federally mandated for the gifted, Lubinski added. “The higher the intellectual ability, the more difficult it may be to match a student with appropriate educational opportunities and curricula. Our study shows what kinds of measures you need to pinpoint the extraordinarily gifted among the gifted students,” he said.</p>
<p>Lubinski concludes that those with extraordinary talent in mathematical and verbal reasoning ultimately were motivated to achieve at higher levels if course material was presented at the advanced rates at which they learned. “<span class="pull-left">Ability, motivation and opportunity all play roles in developing exceptional human capacity and providing the support needed to cultivate it throughout life,” he said.</span></p>
<p>Lubinski and Benbow are co-directors of <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/publications/david-lubinski">Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth</a>. SMPY is a longitudinal study of more than 5,000 intellectually talented participants that focuses on recognizing different types of intellectually precocious students and discovering conditions for enhancing their educational and vocational development. The individuals selected for the study were culled from the SMPY group.<em> </em></p>
<p>Support for the study was provided by a research and training grant from the <a href="http://www.templeton.org">Templeton Foundation</a> and by the <a href="http://www.nichd.nih.gov/Pages/index.aspx">Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development</a> grant P30 HD 15051 to the <a href="http://kc.vanderbilt.edu/site/default.aspx">Vanderbilt Kennedy Center for Research on Human Development</a>.</p>

It might not feel fun to say, &#8220;My child has cancer,&#8221; but the label /diagnosis is what gets the child the care he/she needs. Whatever the label used to describe kids with an IQ of 140 or 150, the point is that those kids need some kind of special / different educational considerations.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen a lot of &#8220;special&#8221; kids developing into shy adults, not having anything to contribute to a world they do not fit into, feeling resent and seclusion. Maybe the world should keep up with them instead of asking them to be patient with the rest, but IMO, that&#8217;s not going to happen, These people need to lead instead of the non-values we see nowadays and the only way that is going to happen is by teaching kids all perspectives that they should be aware of.</p>

Thankfully they were smart and made certain I had access to the resources I needed to stay interested, engaged and out of trouble. Not everyone has teaches or parents to advocate for them. And in some schools, the teachers are actually part of the problem. They either feel threatened (happened to me) or don&#8217;t know how to teach to highly intelligent learners. This needs to be addressed.</p>

The same people who whine about &#8216;gifted&#8217; education being elitist are the same types who howl when sports programs are cut back. A local school district gutted their G and T program, then turned around and spent 500k putting field turf on the football stadium&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t disagree that our education system should challenge all, but the problem is we have this cult of ignorance a la Sarah Palin that says that bright kids are somehow &#8216;not real&#8217;, and as a result, instead of challenging curricula, we see school dumbed down to her level. Schools are letting kids take AP classes who aren&#8217;t equipped for them, and then the teacher spends all the time helping these kids try to keep up, and the rest of the class suffers.</p>

The problem with mixed classrooms is the kids at either end don&#8217;t get what they need. Kids at the upper end zone out, often coast, then don&#8217;t achieve their potential,and the &#8216;answers&#8217; out there are a crock. &#8220;Oh, the bright kids should act as teacher&#8217;s assistants to help with the slower kids&#8221;&#8230;..the problem with that is it might keep them from twiddling their thumbs, but what do they get out of it? </p>
<p>I am not saying gifted kids should be separated out, or be &#8216;above&#8217; other students, but making them plod along with everyone else is not learning to deal, it is learning that they are supposed to pretend to be &#8216;average&#8217; to get along. Mixed classrooms only work when the teacher can apply individual attention to meet needs, but what it means in todays schools is they teach to the lowest common denominator. </p>
<p>I have seen mixed classrooms work, my son was/is gifted, and he went to a private school where the kids abilities ranged..and the teachers made sure he was part of the class, while also challenging him and making sure he was being fed intellectually, too,rather then simply telling him to follow along with the class. When a kid is reading on a graduate level and is being made to plod through a reading book that they have finished reading, it isn&#8217;t teaching them anything.</p>

I was given many IQ tests, all of which qualified me as &#8220;scary smart,&#8221; but since I wasn&#8217;t interested in playing violin, chess, or joining the math club &#8211; I obviously wasn&#8217;t one of the &#8220;gifted ones.&#8221; I was eventually was referred to a &#8220;Talented and Gifted&#8221; group in Junior High, but I failed the interview.My mother, who worked in my high school guidance department found out why: there was a note in my records from the school psychologist (who had presided over the interview for the club) noting that no child of my age could have read the books that I had described reading, therefore I was obviously a pathological liar. I am now, at 43, a senior at Harvard with a 3.9 GPA. I work full-time and take three classes a semester as there are few grants or scholarships available for &#8220;older&#8221; students. I intend to continue and complete my PhD &#8211; I made the most of my life, and I have no regrets &#8211; but I can&#8217;t help still being angry with the &#8220;system&#8221; that applied so many labels to me as a child&#8230;labels that stuck and haunted me for years. Labels that even my parents believed&#8230;</p>

IDEA provides free and appropriate public education for a group that was previously vulnerable. All children deserve an education which adds to their quality of life. There certainly should be an emphasis on challenging students who are two standard deviations above the mean (gifted) as you indicate, and this is a challenge that public school systems should rise to. To me, your statement came off as a bit snarky. Maybe you meant to say this in a different way?</p>

I&#8217;m not saying they don&#8217;t need the help &#8211; they certainly do and they should get it. But those above the mean should get support for it, too. Our cookie-cutter educational programs don&#8217;t reach far enough to help the gifted.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-2283" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What?  Identifying and serving gifted kids has to stop?  So, what, we just leave them to suffer through coursework that they have already mastered?  That&#8217;s the fastest way to end up with a bunch of unhappy, underachieving kids.  </p>
<p>They are gifted. It&#8217;s a fact. They weren&#8217;t just randomly &#8220;pegged&#8221; as gifted &#8211; they were intellectually (and often in other areas too) advanced from the start. They didn&#8217;t &#8220;turn out to be more intelligent&#8221; as a result of the advanced programming.  They started out that way, and (shocking!) had their advanced needs met (at least some of them did) rather than being expected to limit their abilities in the name of fitting into the general education mold that only meets the needs of most typically developing kids.</p>
<p>Although many people think that identifying the gifted kids is somehow elitist (or something else), it is not.  Noting that a kid is gifted does not mean we are saying that they are &#8220;better&#8221; than others; just that they are different and have different needs. </p>
<p>The gifted kids didn&#8217;t necessarily receive &#8220;better instruction and training.&#8221; It was more advanced than that of their age-mates..  Because they were capable of working at that more advanced level.  Their typically developing peers of the same age are not able to do the same level of work..So we could bring in all the advanced-level work to all children that we want, but they would not benefit from it because they cannot (yet) do it.  It is too advanced.  Which is why gifted kids need to be identified &#8211; so that their needs are also being met, rather than being left to languish in a grade level based solely on their age rather than on their capabilities.</p>
<p>Fairness means every child gets what he or she needs.  Gifted kids need more advanced curriculum that moves more quickly than that which meets the learning needs of typically developing kids of the same age.  It is your own &#8220;ideology&#8221; that is holding U.S. education back &#8211; the idea that all kids should get the same instruction regardless of their ability level.  Typically developing kids should have strong learning environments that meet their needs.  And so should gifted kids.  Which means that they may have different learning environments at least part of the time, if we&#8217;re doing things right.</p>

And, no, you can&#8217;t always get those needs met in the regular classroom. It&#8217;s just like kids with learning disabilities &#8212; they have special needs. It&#8217;s not right that we support those efforts at the other end of the spectrum, and just because these kids are smart they&#8217;re expected to fend for themselves. I&#8217;m a single parent and I can&#8217;t meet my daughter&#8217;s needs when I&#8217;m trying to work and run a household. We can&#8217;t afford an extra tutor or special programs.

However, I&#8217;m not sure the role of public education is to offer a customized education program to each student &#8211; nice as that would be.</p>
<p>We will always have limited public resources, and therefore must define limited goals for our institutions. It seems to me that the goal of public education should be to level the playing field between rich and poor, such that all American children have access to a good, standard quality of education; an education which more or less guarantees a minimum level of mental ability; an education can help them towards leading more fulfilling lives, and will allow them to take their turn at becoming productive (and tax paying) members of society.</p>
<p>If you want to go beyond that, and give your child a customized experience, or to teach him about Allah or Jesus, or to prep him intensively for sport or science, then that&#8217;s up to you.</p>

<p>Gifted children have the potential to grow and learn at an accelerated pace &#8211; if the educational opportunities are there. They have the ability to amass great amounts of human capital &#8211; skills, knowledge, and abilities &#8211; but only if they are exposed to them.</p>
<p>So, human capital is all about the person&#8217;s value as a human being. Yes, the more human capital you have, the more capable you will be in generating financial capital for yourself, your company, and society. But that&#8217;s a by-product of having human capital, not the goal.</p>
