                    <div class="post-content content"><p>This is a long post but it&#8217;s worth the read.  In short, Google and Dell have teamed up to install some software on Dell computers that borders on being spyware.  I say spyware because it&#8217;s hard to figure out what it is and is even harder to remove.  It also breaks all kinds of OpenDNS functionality. At the end, I&#8217;ll tell you what we&#8217;re doing about it.</p>
<p>About a year ago <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-6077051.html">Google and Dell announced a partnership</a> to include the Google Toolbar on new Dell computers.  At the same time, Google was trying to convince the Department of Justice that changing the default search engine in the (then) new IE7 <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&#038;res=9A00E2DD113FF932A35756C0A9609C8B63">was too difficult</a> (when in reality it&#8217;s really simple).  Installing the toolbar meant that users would have Google as their default search engine in IE7.  It also meant that Dell and Google would share some of the revenue from the advertising clicks that resulted from these installations, much like The Mozilla Foundation does with its Firefox browser.</p>
<p>The computer hardware business has razor-thin margins which means making a profit is tough.  So the opportunity for Dell to get a recurring revenue stream from an existing customer long after the sale of the computer is more than just enticing, it&#8217;s huge. It also means a couple other things: </p>
<ol>
<li>Dell and Google have an incentive to make it very hard for users to turn this off.</li>
<li>Because users can&#8217;t get rid of it, Dell and Google can get away with putting more ads on the page and pushing user-relevant content off the page.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: center">
<h3>They&#8217;re now doing both of these things.</h3>
</div>
<p>The screenshot below shows what the <a href="http://www.google.com/hws/dell/afe?hl=en&#038;s=http://digg.xom">Dell-branded Google search results page</a> looks like when you make a typo in your address bar.  <strong>You can&#8217;t even see the search results in the picture</strong> (800&#215;600 resolution) because the entire top of the page and right side are plastered with ads.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://shared.opendns.com/img/dell-digg-xom-800x600.png" title="This is a dead-end full of ads, devoid of value." rel="lightbox"><br />
  <img src="http://shared.opendns.com/img/dell-digg-xom-800x600-thumb.png" border="0" /><br />
</a></div>
<p></p>
<p>This page isn&#8217;t being shown to Dell owners just because they have the Google Toolbar. In fact, <strong>uninstalling the Google Toolbar won&#8217;t get rid of it.</strong>  Dell and Google are now installing a second program on computers that intercepts all sorts of queries that the browser would normally try to resolve.  This program has no clear name and is very hard to uninstall.  In some circles, people would call this <a href="http://www.dellcommunity.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=si_virus&#038;message.id=48440">spyware</a>.</p>
<p>Google tries to <a href="http://www.google.com/hws/dell/afe?">explain</a> the hidden software with this ambiguous statement:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://shared.opendns.com/img/google_dell_whatsthis.gif" /></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>Wow.</strong>  Are you kidding me? In order for a user to get rid of this brokenness the person has to remove a piece of software called &#8220;Browser Address Error Redirector?&#8221;  That barely makes sense to techies and it makes no sense to normal people.  Would your Mom uninstall something with a name like that?  I don&#8217;t think so. </p>
<p>Not only that, but due to some support inquiries we&#8217;ve gotten it seems like this software is being installed on older Dell computers that use some sort of automatic update service from Dell.  Is this <em>thing</em> spreading?  Ugh.  How bad is it?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what happens with certain queries and what shows up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_the_fold">above the fold</a>.  For good measure, I&#8217;ve included what we do too, for comparison.</p>
<pre>
<strong>Typed               Dell/Google             OpenDNS</strong>
Digg.xom            Paid results            Automatically typo-corrected
Digg                Paid results            Shortcut / Search results
Digg,com            Paid results            Search results
</pre>
<p class="small">As an aside, for every single one of these pages, OpenDNS provides an unpaid link at the top of the page asking, &#8220;Did you mean <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg.com</a>?&#8221;  If Google and Dell were really trying to give users a good experience, they would offer that, at the very least.  They are certainly smart enough.</p>
<h4>What do we do for the user?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve included a screenshot of what OpenDNS shows people, too, for comparison:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://shared.opendns.com/img/opendns-digg-com-800x600.png" title="We try to help you navigate to where you want to go." rel="lightbox"><br />
  <img src="http://shared.opendns.com/img/opendns-digg-com-800x600-thumb.png" border="0" /><br />
</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Is Google being true to their roots?</h4>
<p>I love Google&#8217;s technology, don&#8217;t get me wrong.  But I think Google has turned a page here.  They have now enabled a piece of software that is hard to remove and forces users to look at a really bad page.  In fact, Google knows that this provides users with a dramatically worse experience. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/3/prweb213516.htm">press release</a> that talks about what people look at while using Google. (You can be sure Google uses similar technology internally.) Here&#8217;s a screenshot, with a red-line indicating what is below the fold.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://shared.opendns.com/img/google_cropped.jpg" title="" rel="lightbox"><br />
  <img src="http://shared.opendns.com/img/google_cropped_thumb.png" border="0" /><br />
</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Dell-branded page doesn’t look anything like that at all. If you were to put a heatmap on the Dell-branded page&#8230; well, users can <strong>only</strong> look at ads. Dell and Google&#8217;s behavior here isn&#8217;t okay. <strong>Users never asked for this experience and they can’t get rid of it!</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, this new &#8220;functionality&#8221; breaks things. Instead of making DNS requests, the address bar now sends single word queries to Google. This application breaks a lot of OpenDNS functionality our users love. Typo correction? Broken. Shortcuts? Broken. Google&#8217;s application breaks just about every user-benefiting feature we provide with <strong>client software that no user ever asked for.</strong></p>
<p>We enjoy challenging problems at OpenDNS. But we&#8217;d rather spend our time making the Internet better rather than solving problems that shouldn&#8217;t have been created in the first place.  <strong>We know that Google is capable of launching great products and services, but this isn&#8217;t one of them.</strong></p>
<h4>How is OpenDNS solving this problem?</h4>
<p>Fortunately, we have a fix which does not require <strong>more</strong> client software. OpenDNS applies intelligence to the network, and we&#8217;ve stretched a bit beyond DNS itself to work around Google&#8217;s mis-directed efforts.  Before I get into that, let me digress for a second:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 16px;">Many of you have toolbars installed on your computer.  Some of you have the Google toolbar, some have the Yahoo toolbar, and some of you have <a href="http://www.zwinky.com/">Zwinky</a> (Don&#8217;t ask&#8230; I think little kids use it).  These toolbars are able to see every single website you visit when you surf the web.  Most report your surfing habits back to the company that operates the toolbar. Toolbars are something worthy to be concerned about, if only because so little attention is paid to them.</p>
<p>Okay, back to our solution.  We did not want to enter the toolbar market. We don’t have any interest in it, and we don’t believe more software installations are the answer. </p>
<p>The solution to this problem was to route Google requests through a machine we run to check if the request is a typo or one of your shortcuts.  If it is a typo or shortcut then we do what we always do, just fix the typo or launch your shortcut and send you off on your way.  If it&#8217;s not one of those two things, we pass it on to Google for them to give you search results.  This solution provides the best of both worlds: OpenDNS users get back the features that they love and Google continues to operate without problems.</p>
<p>I want people to know (and be sure) that we aren&#8217;t doing anything shady. We&#8217;re not spying on you.  <strong>We don&#8217;t care what websites you visit.</strong> (Check our <a href="http://www.opendns.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>.) Solving the issue like this allows us to fix the problems with Google (and future similar services) without having to route all your traffic through a toolbar or other service.</p>
<p>Below, there is a mini-FAQ. I know a bunch of you are very technical might have additional questions about how this works.  We&#8217;re happy to talk about it.  To keep this post from getting unwieldy I&#8217;ve made a page where you can <a href="http://blog.opendns.com/2007/05/22/opendns-proxy-faq">ask all the technical questions</a> you want.  I&#8217;ll read the comments and update that page with answers as they come in.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>  <a href="http://searchengineland.com/070523-083042.php">Danny Sullivan</a> has a great write-up on this too.</p>
<h4>Mini-FAQ</h4>
<div><strong>Will this make Google slower?</strong></div>
<p>No.  We are doing this URL redirection on all of our servers in all of our locations.  Loading Google should take no longer than it took before we made this change.  Also, all of Google&#8217;s other domains like like <tt>gmail.com</tt> and even subdomains like <tt>reader.google.com</tt> still work as they did before.  We don&#8217;t re-route any of those.</p>
<div><strong>Are you tracking or keeping a log of my searches?</strong></div>
<p>No way.  Absolutely not.  We don&#8217;t keep copies of your cookies, your search history or anything else that would cause an <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/277">AOL Search disaster</a>.  Any logs we have for technical debugging are wiped within an hour of the request, usually much sooner.  We also aren&#8217;t in a position to log it for the government, and we aren&#8217;t a front for the CIA.  &#8220;The Feds&#8221; already know that if they want to know what websites you visit they can just talk to your ISP, unfortunately. </p>
<div><strong>Does this break anything?</strong></div>
</p>
<p>Nope, but let us know if you see anything awry.</p>
<div><strong>What about secure logins to Google?  Can you see them?</strong></div>
<p>No.  Typically when people try to proxy SSL pages it creates an error.  We didn&#8217;t want that to happen so we did something we think is pretty clever.  We actually just forward your packets on to Google when you are doing anything that is secure.  This keeps your data encrypted and ensures we can&#8217;t perform a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_middle_attack">Man in the middle</a> attack on you.</p>
<div><strong>Does Google know about this?</strong></div>
</p>
<p>We contacted a couple of friends who work on the security side of things at Google to give them a friendly heads up.  They said it&#8217;s not a technical or security problem on their end. Based on that we don&#8217;t think Google has any problem with it.  The technology we&#8217;re using is pretty standard stuff.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one thing for Google and Dell to work together to make sure that Google is the search engine of choice, but it&#8217;s another to break commonplace browser and DNS technologies to force advertisements. It&#8217;s just creepy (kinda like those geo-targeted personal ads).</p>
<p>The one thing that I actually like about Google is the fact that they&#8217;ve always been very adamant about differentiating between sponsored and algorithmic search results. Did they think people wouldn&#8217;t call them on this?</p>
<p>I also wanted to point out another thing with OpenDNS&#8217; search results page that David really hasn&#8217;t mentioned (and is personally amazing to me). OpenDNS is creating REALLY impressive capabilities without ever having to have users install software. Shortcuts, blocked sites, typo correction, phishing protection &#8211; useful tools without invading privacy or forcing advertisements.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a right way and a wrong way to direct traffic to the correct destination, and I hope people can tell the difference.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first and certainly not the last time that a vendor will do this kind of crap to users, remember the Acer activeX issue last year (I can&#8217;t find a link right now but it was widely reported).</p>
<p>For a corporate or large enterprise this kind of software is less likely to be installed because of techs building custom SOE&#8217;s but for small &amp; medium business who can&#8217;t afford a dedicated SOE or the casual mom and pop users it&#8217;s a worry.</p>

<p>But yea, once I uninstalled that redirector service, the errors stopped.</p>
<p>And of course, the box was shipped out, set to some custom Acer search page&#8230;</p>
<p>And well, as an FYI, Acer appears to be Gateway (or vice-versa&#8230;lol however those mergers work)&#8230;so I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s more than just Dell.</p>
<p>Back in 1995 when I got my first Packard Bell desktop, I was astonished with all of the trial software and crap they had pre-loaded&#8230;..it appears now these corporations must make enough money from Google, by simply loading Google Desktop, Google Toolbar, and maybe an optional URL Redirector&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe we should take this case over to the guys at PC-decrapier.com (originally hoisted as the Dell Decrapifier AFAIK :P&#8230;.but obviously renamed for decrapification of all desktops that are bought from Wally World and assorted retailer chains.</p>
<p>And yea, I think I&#8217;ve mentioned about this URL Redirector software within the forums at one time or another&#8230;.I just cant remember when/where&#8230;.</p>

<p>David makes two claims:</p>
<p>   1. Dell and Google have an incentive to make it very hard for users to turn this off.<br />
   2. Because users can&#8217;t get rid of it, Dell and Google can get away with putting more ads on the page and pushing user-relevant content off the page.</p>
<p>The first claim is true, Dell/Google does have an &#8216;incentive&#8217; to make it hard for users to turn off.  However, the implication made here is false.  This is an attempt to subtly convince readers that Dell/Google actually did make it hard to turn this off which is false.  The claim that its &#8220;very hard to uninstall&#8221; is almost laughable, using &#8220;Add/Remove Programs&#8221; is the functionality people would expect to remove software.  Moreover, the Dell/Google results page (<a href="http://www.google.com/hws/dell/afe" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/hws/dell/afe</a>?) actually tells the user exactly how to remove it.  I have never seen &#8216;spyware&#8217; that is this transparent and user-friendly. </p>
<p>The second claim then uses the false assumption from the first point to further mislead the reader into thinking &#8216;it cannot be removed&#8217; which is obviously false.</p>
<p>This is propaganda with an agenda, and I am sad to see OpenDNS drop to this level.  OpenDNS relies on typo squatting for revenue, which means that they see this as a threat to their wallet.<br />
From wikipedia: &#8220;OpenDNS earns a portion of its revenue by displaying advertisements on a search page shown when their system cannot automatically correct a domain name typo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the Dell/Google application will detect typos before being passed to their DNS servers, the real concern from OpenDNS is their revenue stream.  </p>
<p>This is not a usability or security issue.  This is a business competition issue that OpenDNS is hoping to create hype in order to scare people into removing the tool and using their service so they can harvest more advertising clicks on with their Yahoo! sponsored results and advertisements.</p>

<p>I knew someone would post something like that.  This isn&#8217;t about OpenDNS vs. Google, this is about delivering users a great experience.  That&#8217;s something Google used to do.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t make money on typo squatting.  In fact, we don&#8217;t make a single cent when we correct typos.  That&#8217;s the point.  We&#8217;re giving people a better experience.  I&#8217;m not sure how you missed that part.</p>
<p>The functionality we&#8217;re fixing here doesn&#8217;t make us a dime.  It&#8217;s typos and shortcuts.  If you go to the box in the top right of your Firefox browser and search, it still goes to Google, of course.</p>
<p>Appreciate the feedback though, and it&#8217;s definitely about the money trail.  As for the software being easy to uninstall, you&#8217;re wrong.  You&#8217;re giving way more credit to the technical clue of computer users than they deserve.</p>

But &#8220;Browser Address Error Redirector&#8221; would immediately get my attention whilst doing the uninstalling, and I wouldn&#8217;t call myself &#8220;techie&#8221;.<br />
A second point I would like to make is, you say that this thing can be uninstalled by finding the prementioned name, the say that you can&#8217;t. Well, can you, or not? This makes you sound melodramatic, and takes a bit away from the argument, I have to say.</p>

<p>Your typical user has no clue about add/remove programs. In fact most would  probably end up taking the PC to a shop to get &#8220;fixed&#8221; and then get ripped off even more. The average user is clueless. Unfortunately the average user will never read this blog or use this service. Or could care less for that matter.</p>
<p>Just makes me sick. You pay for a PC and they install all this crap on there really without your permission. I&#8217;m sure it is somewhere in the TOS but not like they tell you this to your face.</p>
<p>Anyways I really hope they all stop doing this. I see DELL probably will some time in the near feature but will charge users. Crazy! Hopefully they will get sued then. I&#8217;m sure someone will be very angry when they find out they are paying not to &#8220;buy&#8221; something. lol</p>

The original article lost a lot of credibility with *me* when I read the phrase &#8220;borders on being spyware&#8221;, because it is *not* &#8220;spyware&#8221; to anyone who understand s what &#8220;spyware&#8221; is, and how this differs. </p>
<p>The use of that term in this context seems to encourage hysteria among the ignorant, and as much as I love opendns, I hate to see them employ such a tactic.</p>
<p>It is also disingenuous to repeatedly and &#8220;loudly&#8221; claim that it is difficult to install and that &#8220;they can’t get rid of it!&#8221; when that is, simply stated, not true.  If that presumption is to be believed, then managing to configure a computer to utilize opendns would be far too difficult for *anyone* to accomplish.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no fan of much of the garbage that is bundled with &#8220;new&#8221; computers these days; but this is not *evil* even if it is driven by &#8220;the money&#8221;; it&#8217;s just a &#8220;side effect&#8221; of how low-priced computers are marketed these days. <img src="http://blog.opendns.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>This has nothing to do with Google, it is to do with Dell, as they are just a publisher like anyone else, and trying to make money through good ads. If you don&#8217;t like it, don&#8217;t buy a Dell. If you want something to complain about, complain about Norton Antivirus &#8211; it stuffs up Windows, and doesn&#8217;t work at all, and THAT is the hardest piece of spyware to remove.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1304" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>My first thought reading this article is that you are trying to fire on Google (&#8220;Google turns the page&#8230; in a bad way&#8221;) while it&#8217;s Dell that should be addressed.</p>
<p>I mean: WHO installs &#8220;Browser Address Error Redirector&#8221;? There&#8217;s some evidence that states that it&#8217;s a tool by Google?<br />
If I make a software that forces any click to be routed to the Google search, who is to blame? Me or Google?</p>
<p>To me, Dell has a pact with Google, Google gives the start page, Dell forces the redirect in order to get more revenue.<br />
And that&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>So, without any other evidence, we could just say that:<br />
1. Dell and Google have a commercial agreement.<br />
2. on a Dell computer there&#8217;s a piece of spiware.</p>
<p>This is a cautious and correct approach. </p>
<p>Now:<br />
1. If you have evidence that &#8220;Browser Address Error Redirector&#8221; is from Google, so you could say that Google &#8220;turns the page in a bad way&#8221;.<br />
2. If you don&#8217;t have such evidence, you have to wait before &#8220;blaming&#8221; Google (using just &#8216;Google&#8217; and not both &#8216;Google&#8217; and &#8216;Dell&#8217; in the title is misleading), since due to Dell&#8217;s history is more likely that it&#8217;s a Dell software.<br />
3. If you have evidence that &#8220;Browser Address Error Redirector&#8221; is from Dell, Google shouldn&#8217;t be cited here.</p>
<p>The final question is: WHO is putting &#8220;Browser Address Error Redirector&#8221; on the Dell PCs?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think most users will get it. They will probably get it after someone explains it to them or they have to call Dell. If they even notice there is a problem.</p>
<p>I have bought Dell in the past. My next home computer will be from Apple. I&#8217;ll probably rebuild it from the ground up just as I do with the Dell (which is getting harder and harder with every new version of Windows it seems). Luckily this is not the case with a Mac.</p>

<p>Its really disappointing to see not one, but two of the companies I have and continue to support go down this dirty path.</p>
<p>Then again, is this any different then the stories (which turned out to be true) about gmail keeping emails databased even after you hit that &#8220;Delete&#8221; link so they can force feed you advertisements tailored to your specific needs?</p>
<p>Simple solution which I&#8217;ve followed long before this came to light:</p>
<p>NEVER CLICK ON ANY SPONSORED LINKS, be it at google or any of the other search engines.</p>
<p>As for Dell&#8230; Tisk tisk, you&#8217;ve just lost any business I, and the IT firm I&#8217;m employed at has to offer. Be it not much, but the $20000 our firm spends on hardware will now go elsewhere. Your loss, not ours.</p>

<p>We would be making money from typo-squatting if we were showing a page of ads when someone types &#8220;linux.xom&#8221; into their browser.  But we don&#8217;t.  We just correct it.  Typo-squatting usually refers to people who make money based on typos of trademark or misspellings of terms.  We don&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p>We make our money when someone types something like &#8220;Golf Clubs&#8221; into their browser.  That&#8217;s functionality that wasn&#8217;t affected here.  If you have Google&#8217;s &#8220;browse by name&#8221; functionality enabled in the toolbar then you go to Google.  If you don&#8217;t, you go to us.  That&#8217;s how we make money and isn&#8217;t impacted by this.  What&#8217;s impacted are the things that don&#8217;t make us money but that our users like.</p>

<p>Some of my work involves technical support and I spend a lot of time talking to end-users. Your assessment suggesting that removing this software would be beyond their capacity is insulting, as well as just plain incorrect. OEMs have been installing crap on their computers as a way to lower out of the box costs for years, and people seem more than happy to accept this trade off. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m speculating here, but I can&#8217;t imagine that the intersection of users who perceive this problem and can&#8217;t figure out how to solve it is very, very small.</p>

Hate them. They are unnecessary and invasive in this age. I was quite annoyed when I saw GOOGLE, off all people, had now managed to insinuate themselves into my new computer.</p>
<p>BUT, I personally found the toolbars relatively easy to uninstall, they appeared on the uninstall program menu and allowed me to delete from there. Although they did put me through one of the &#8220;Why have you uninstalled this add-on?&#8221; page. Unfortunately for me &#8220;It&#8217;s a useless, unwanted and unsolicited attempt to raise revenue in a questionable way&#8221; was not one of the choices&#8230;</p>

It seems handy but there are a lot of security risks with making your personal desktop accessible to Google. May be I don&#8217;t understand, but does Google desk top automatically make your personal desktop web accessible to the general public? I notice that the Google Desktop is constantly active- indexing files in the task bar. I would personally un-install this software, but these are not my computers. Does anyone know what the memory usage on the google desktop indexing is? Am I right to assume the worse about this software? I already feel compromised enough having to use a MS OS. Last thing I need to worry about is my girlfriend getting a notice from RIAA for copying her cds to itunes after he desktop is googled.</p>

To use it requires a conscious decision on the part of the user to modify his or her DNS entries to take advantage of the OpenDNS service. In doing so, you should understand what you&#8217;re getting, and agree to either help OpenDNS generate revenue by using their service, or not, and rely on your ISP&#8217;s DNS. It&#8217;s your choice, so you can&#8217;t complain.</p>
<p>What Dell and Google are doing is totally different, in that Dell users are getting this installed out of the gate. Dell probably doesn&#8217;t add this as a line item on the invoice, and users won&#8217;t even know it&#8217;s there until it kicks in. That&#8217;s a HUGE difference between setting up a service yourself, and having it set up for you.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the Google software actually impacts the precise money-making mechanism of OpenDNS, the fact is that some parts of OpenDNS dont&#8217; work as well on machines with this software installed.  The OpenDNS &#8220;experience&#8221; is degenerated somewhat, which reduces their appeal, which overall diminishes their product, and that is bound to impact OpenDNS usage &#8211; which certainly DOES impact their revenue.</p>
<p>David, insisting otherwise, and ignoring Swoon&#8217;s very pertinent points about deliberately using flawed logic in your argument, weakens your position IMHO.  Then again, so does this entire conversation &#8220;alerting&#8221; the community.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I love OpenDNS for one thing and one thing only &#8211; the speed.  Every once in a while, I fat finger something and wind up on an ad page, and every so often I do follow the ad link that results.  I sincerely hope that pays the bills for OpenDSN, since to me as a user the value of the entire operation is obvious and compelling.  I don&#8217;t use OpenDNS as a search engine and have no interest in doing so; I find their search results overall to be inferior to Google&#8217;s (no surprise there, is it?)</p>
<p>The new (to me, anyway) function of analyzing my queries more closely to see if it&#8217;s a Google software function makes me uncomfortable.  I want OpenDNS to do one thing &#8211; look up DNS queries.  That&#8217;s it.  You&#8217;re good at it, please leave the rest alone.</p>
<p>David, if I begin to distrust OpenDNS, I&#8217;ll move myself and my clients away in a hearbeat &#8211; it&#8217;s as easy to do as it was to begin using the service.  And THAT will impact revenue much more than Google/Dell.</p>

<p>Only yesterday my sister bought a Dell laptop and when browsing on it I noticed the Dell/Google ad page. It filled the whole screen virtually even on a 1280&#215;800 resolution. The must make a bomb off all those clicks. Let&#8217;s face it people who are new to computers and mostly beginners buy off Dell.. First time PC, family PC and they&#8217;re not going to know what they&#8217;re clicking are ads.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see OpenDNS have done something about it , nice work.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the point actually but you have it backwards.  Dell and Google <strong>ARE NOT</strong> providing any link to digg.com.  They could, it&#8217;s obvious.  They could just redirect you.  They don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re right, I&#8217;m sorry.  That wasn&#8217;t how I intended it to come out.  I meant that general, non-tech savvy computer users can&#8217;t do it easily.  I certainly didn&#8217;t mean it to be offensive. </p>
<p>I know it sounds easy to &#8220;Add/Remove Programs&#8221; but when logged in as a non-administrator on an XP box you can&#8217;t do it.  I tried here at the office.  And a lot of people who have computers set up for them are configured (for their own good) to not be logged in as the administrator on the account.</p>
<p>Also, why doesn&#8217;t the software have any indication of where it came from?  Most software has a clear name or the company that installed it in the &#8220;Add/Remove Programs&#8221; control panel.  The lack of that is what makes it feel like spyware.</p>

<p>Open up add-ons for IE. Disable CBrowserHelperObject Object from Dell/Googe. Go into MSCONFIG, disable anything from Dell or Google within Services and check your Start Up items as well for Google desktop etc&#8230;Reboot. Head on over to your add/remove items and toss Google Desktop out the window. Also get rid of URLSearch Assistant and that other assistant which has no publisher tied to it (can&#8217;t remember the name right now). Reboot again. You should be good to go.</p>
<p>*Note.: This is for any system from Dell that comes with the factory image. You can always reinstall the OS, hopefully without an OEM version, and that should take care of any issues or doubts that there are some bugged out items on the computer.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not my point. My point is that this blog post seems to call out Google/Dell for taking advantage of Internet users with this technology, and I think the underlying reason for this post is more than that. I don&#8217;t believe OpenDNS is some kind of consumer watchdog looking out for us. If Google/Dell didn&#8217;t break the OpenDNS service, I doubt we&#8217;d be reading about this.</p>

<p>Your blog readers are giving &#8220;way more credit to the technical clue of [opendns bloggers]&#8221; than you deserve if you think a program with such an obvious name and instructions is anything close to spyware.  Obviously you guys dont read a lot of pr0n and have to remove spyware daily.  I suggest starting with some bangbus.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know what opendns is, but it&#8217;s pretty obvious they&#8217;re scared of OEMs pulling these kinds of tricks and taking away from their marketshare.</p>

Refusing to buy Dell hardware just because of an easily-removed software package is stupid.  Are you really willing to pay more to get the same hardware from someone else?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about the rest of you, but the first thing I do when I receive a new Dell system here in the office is to reinstall it from the restore CD.  Anyone who doesn&#8217;t reimage an OEM system is just asking for trouble&#8230;</p>

Customers that don&#8217;t understand how a computer works or just don&#8217;t want to understand will never go to &#8220;Add/Remove Programs.&#8221;   The name &#8220;Browser Address Error Redirector&#8221; will only convince this customer group to never uninstall this program or create some doubt on the decision to delete it. </p>
<p>My view on this subject is coming from the line of work I do.   I work with these customers everyday and help them fix things they don&#8217;t understand.   Most of these people think the address bar is the Google search bar or some other search bar.</p>
<p>This will only increase frustration with my customers and myself when trying to troubleshoot over the phone.    Something that could take a few minutes over the phone could involve a trip to there place of business.</p>
<p>My two cents or the cost of the customers.</p>

I could have sworn Google had a &#8220;do no evil&#8221; clause in their Privacy statement, and this reads pure evil. Just because Dell is having a hell of a time turning a profit, doesn&#8217;t mean you have to sleep with them Google. I was just starting to like Dell again too for the Ubuntu preinstallations, and now this. Now I like Google less&#8230; and well, Dell is back to where they were in my rankings.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great article, and I can&#8217;t thank you enough for your great product. I included OpenDNS in a &#8220;Safe surfing&#8221; article I published on my website, and I think its one of the more important ones.</p>

<p>The first is what people see who are <strong>LOCKED IN</strong> to the service.  The last two are what users see when they have choice and can pick the best service or product in an open market.  That&#8217;s why this is spyware.  It&#8217;s the only way to get away with it.  </p>
<p>Ironic that this is similar to what Google complains about to the Department of Justice with regards to IE7 and Microsoft.</p>
<p>When you have choice and an open market you get a great experience.  When you are locked-in you don&#8217;t.  That&#8217;s what this is about.</p>

<p>I mean come on guys. They tell you where to go and what to click on to remove it. So dont slam them by trying to imply people arent going to remove it because the name is weird, when google explicitly tells you what name to click on to remove it.</p>
<p>Other then that one point, i agree with the rest. This peice of software is crap for the user and borders on being spyware. It benefits no one except dell/google.</p>

<p>The only way I can think this works is if the google/dell application is intercepting DNS queries before passing them onto the actual recursive DNS server.  </p>
<p>The way I understand it, if I am an open DNS user, is that whatever is typed into the address bar is queried against the OpenDNS&#8217;s servers.  Open DNS never returns NXDOMAIN to the browser you either redirect or display an openDNS web page.</p>
<p>Address bar (type microsoft.xom) &#8211;&gt; google &#8211;&gt; NXDOMAIN (not returned to browser)  &#8211;&gt; google/dell results page returned to browser. </p>
<p>Does anyone know if that is how it works?  If so, this is appalling.</p>

This is my experience:  I bought a Dell laptop, and on first boot it prompts me to accept the user license for the google desktop and IE toolbar.  I DECLINED, and it reported it was uninstalling itself.  Guess what, the google desktop was still there front and central!  So I went into add/remove programs and took it off myself.  Then I opened IE and got all the google as home page and default search for IE.  Fine, I can change that too.  Except that it does not take.  I can no longer change my browser&#8217;s default search!  No matter what I do, my searches and bad URLs take me to Google.  I got so frustrated I had to pave the entire system and reinstall windows from scratch (fortunately I have MSDN subscription and install media).  The more I thought about it the more I could not support this sort of conspiracy and returned the machine to Dell.  The last I will ever buy from them.</p>

<p>The second: Gmail. When they offered deal to read (or render) private mails,whether they are precious or not just for a lousy outdated POP3 protocol and smtp, that was the second hit. That was the time when people seriously questioned them and both EFF since they silenced and put a google search to their site while perl geniuses could code for them free.</p>
<p>Third: Adwords. It is beyond anything you can imagine, I am horrified by the stuff advertised on Adwords and the &#8220;click here to install virus&#8221; ad didn&#8217;t surprise me at all.</p>
<p>You know what? Once upon a time there was an online giant which postmasters/admins had to force unfilter their horrible IP space just because it is widely used. They also took a great browser and killed it in just 2 years especially because of privacy concerns. In 1995, if you said openly that they would be dead, entire userbase would run away, people would laugh at you. See what happens now.</p>
<p>I started to think about blocking Google on my machine/network because I really started to get nervous here. I am not buying a $2000 proactive device to a house either.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/04/google_desktop_installer" rel="nofollow">http://daringfireball.net/2007/04/google_desktop_installer</a> for more info.</p>
<p>If there is a team/suit team deciding these types of acts, Google should really get rid of them very quick. There is a possibility to make Microsoft an Internet giant which they always dreamed of but never succeeded. A single, credible proof can change things in matter of days on Internet these times.</p>
<p>Again: THAT IS NOT SPYWARE, it is just pushing the boundaries and security too much.</p>

And I think that the author had overreacted just a bit when he kept repeating that this &#8216;thing&#8217; cannot be removed. It&#8217;s removed like any other program in Windows. It even has a nice descriptive name.</p>
<p>Why is anyone using IE7 at all? For the spyware? If the user was concerned about spyware he would be using Firefox. Or do like me, and switch to Ubuntu.</p>

<p>You haven&#8217;t read this post then.  Google is the enabler here.  They&#8217;re the ones doing this.  The same URL works for Sony, eMachines and Gateway. </p>
<p>They paid Dell a ton of money to get their software installed.  Now they need to recoup that cost.  This is how they are recouping it, I think.</p>

<p>@GatewayGuy- That&#8217;s what was occuring with me.  Acer had a &#8220;homepage&#8221; set for some search page, &#8220;powered by AOL&#8221; (gasp, not Google?)&#8230;but yea, and my hosts file was blocking some &#8220;in-line avertisements&#8221; and was stuffing up the page loading&#8230;that&#8217;s how I noticed.  So I guess they haven&#8217;t fixed that bug you speak of <img src="http://blog.opendns.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   haha.  And well, I dont know, when Acer called me back after I got disconnected (actually, I hung up on them, but how kind to call me back? lol) the number on callerID showed as &#8220;Gateway&#8221; so that&#8217;s what I was figuring&#8230;</p>
<p>@Xigre- they aren&#8217;t THAT bad, after you <a href="http://www.yorkspace.com/pc-de-crapifier/" rel="nofollow">Decrapify</a> them <img src="http://blog.opendns.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />   Or, refer to the above; regarding the WIndows refund&#8230;and well hey, there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from 1) getting your refund, 2) formatting the hard drive(s)/partition(s) completely, 3) buying a &#8220;clean&#8221; copy of Windows from the shelf at your local software store, and use that&#8230;</p>
<p>And well, as far as the &#8220;owner&#8221; of this URL Redirection software&#8230;I have no idea, I doubt it is google though&#8230;Dell probably paid some guy to create it <img src="http://blog.opendns.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>@Alexandar Tzanov- that&#8217;s when you go in and change their home/search page <img src="http://blog.opendns.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />   I did it when I went to my dad&#8217;s house..he hasn&#8217;t asked me about it since&#8230;hell, I even loaded up OpenDNS on his sytem since I know he uses PayPal and eBay to buy goodies.  Haven&#8217;t heard any, &#8220;why does this look different?&#8221; gripes yet <img src="http://blog.opendns.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>P.S. I heard Dell is great, if you buy a PC from them that has Windows on it, if you call em up, and tell them you don&#8217;t wish to use Windows, they will send you a refund, after they cancel your Windows activation code ofcourse&#8230;so I heard a couple months back in the blog-o-sphere&#8230;</p>

<p>Please have an honest discussion about this, and don&#8217;t restrict the conversation to just domain typos.</p>
<p>Both OpenDNS and Google/Dell redirect the user to ads when they type keywords into the address bar.  As we saw with the AOL/Search data leak, hundreds of thousands of people do this all the time.</p>
<p>Your discussion is less than honest when you only focus on domain typos, and not keywords &#8212; both are entered by mistake into the address bar, and both OpenDNS and Google/Dell redirect the user to ads.</p>

OpenDNS doesn&#8217;t disclose anything, and many users (such as employees of an organization) have *no way to change* that behavior with OpenDNS.</p>
<p>For you to criticize Google for this practice, when it&#8217;s Google who is being open and honest while OpenDNS is rather sneaky about the whole thing, is the height of hypocrisy on your part.</p>

<p>I think we&#8217;re having an honest discussion.  Let&#8217;s look at the what you say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your discussion is less than honest when you only focus on domain typos, and not keywords — both are entered by mistake into the address bar, and both OpenDNS and Google/Dell redirect the user to ads.</p></blockquote>
<p>First, both services point them to webpages.  And both have ads.  The  point of my blog post wasn&#8217;t which is better (ours is) but that Google used to be putting the end-user experience first and foremost.  They aren&#8217;t doing that anymore.  That&#8217;s why they&#8217;ve turned a page.  They are putting their partnership with Dell first, at the expense of the user-experience.  And because users are locked-in.</p>
<p>You then say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The big difference which you’ve been completely silent about is that Google prominently displays what’s going on and how the user can change that behavior if they don’t like it. OpenDNS doesn’t disclose anything, and many users (such as employees of an organization) have *no way to change* that behavior with OpenDNS.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes no sense.  OpenDNS is a service that people choose to use.  We don&#8217;t have any software that installs anything on your computer.  If a company decides to use OpenDNS, then that means that someone has made the decision to use OpenDNS.  Companies aren&#8217;t ISPs.  There&#8217;s a reason we don&#8217;t sell to ISPs and that&#8217;s a big part of it.</p>
<p>And you conclude by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>
For you to criticize Google for this practice, when it’s Google who is being open and honest while OpenDNS is rather sneaky about the whole thing, is the height of hypocrisy on your part.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think you switched OpenDNS and Google in that sentence, or you don&#8217;t understand how OpenDNS works.  In fact, that you can even comment and have a dialog with me on this blog refutes exactly what you just said.  And, of course, at the top of every <a href="http://guide.opendns.com/s?q=Testing" rel="nofollow">guide.opendns.com</a> page we have a link at the top that says &#8220;Why am I here?&#8221;  It doesn&#8217;t get much more transparent than that.</p>
<p>Thanks for the comment, I hope I cleared some things up. <img src="http://blog.opendns.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

Mainly because I&#8217;ve supported many computers that still have MSN/Dell Google as the home page simply because the user didn&#8217;t know how to change it.  The difference with OpenDNS is that you have to be somewhat technically savvy just to set it up.  Or at least smart enough to follow some screenshots.</p>
<p>To say that uninstalling for most people is easy is akin to saying your cell phone contract is written in plain English.  Sure the words are English, but it takes some legal understanding to make sense of it all.</p>
<p>And to all you people that say David is just mentioning this because of his affiliation with OpenDNS, Duh!  But ask yourself this.  How would you feel if OpenDNS struck up a deal with Dell and every computer came with OpenDNS&#8217;s servers pre-configured?  Would that be ok?</p>

I see nobody noticed the similar &#8220;What&#8217;s this&#8221; link at the top of the Dell/Sony/eMachines/Gateway pages. Hmm, just like OpenDNS! This nullfies the entire argument. There&#8217;s a link that says what it is and how to remove it.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m sure most new computer users will not notice the link and/or not care and just deal with it and find their way. And I do think it&#8217;s crummy that they&#8217;re engaging in this practice. But, when you buy a chea.. er.. low-cost computer, you get what you pay for.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1461" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is very disturbing that Google is involved in such underhanded and &#8220;bottom of the barrel&#8221; tactics, just to secure their place as the default search engine in Internet Explorer on Microsoft Windows Vista. They&#8217;re clearly more afraid of Microsoft than I had thought, if this is their way of protecting their Web search dominance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s disturbing enough they force a browser toolbar down your proverbial throat in the Google Toolbar (which I do find useful and do use myself) when you purchase a new computer under the guise of being helpful, but to then also install a separate program with seemingly &#8220;helpful&#8221; program names like URL Assistant, Browser Address Error Redirector or GoogleAFE without any user consent is absolute garbage. It&#8217;s like VeriSign&#8217;s SiteFinder, except it&#8217;s worse because (a) it&#8217;s a client-side program installed on one&#8217;s computer whereas VeriSign simply wildcarded the root zone files for its managed generic TLDs &#8220;.com&#8221;, &#8220;.net&#8221;, and &#8220;.org&#8221; and (b) it was never asked for in the first place. True, SiteFinder was never asked for either, but at least they didn&#8217;t junk up your computer and Windows registry with extraneous entries. It&#8217;s exactly like what Claria&#8217;s GAIN advertising software did.</p>
<p>To top it off, they take up the entire screen &#8220;above the fold&#8221; with sponsored advertising links of some sort, either on top or on the side. That&#8217;s not helpful. I realize they want to make money so I don&#8217;t have a problem with the sponsored links, but they could put some at the bottom of the page, below the fold, and also do what OpenDNS does (if they have to have this in the first place, that is) and David has suggested by putting a helpful &#8216;Did you mean ?&#8217; flag at the top. (As an aside, do they share the ad revenue with the OEMs like Dell, eMachines, and Gateway or do they pay them a huge, guaranteed and lump-sum fee then keep the ad revenue for themselves? Or do they do both?) It&#8217;s also not exactly the same as what ISPs, either, because they presumably set up an advanced zone file or series of zone files at the DNS level.</p>
<p>Besides which, there are other ways Google could&#8217;ve done this (again, if they felt it was absolutely critical), such as editing the computer&#8217;s DNS servers to use Google&#8217;s or the computer manufacturer&#8217;s and setting up their redirection services server-side at the DNS level, like OpenDNS does and some ISPs do. Oh, and this would be in addition to placing ads better and using helpful flags &#8211; or just simply redirecting typo&#8217;ed domains!</p>
<p>Some have suggested we follow the money, and believe me, that&#8217;s the first thing I thought of when I first started reading this post. OpenDNS does display some contextually-targeted advertising (like through Google&#8217;s AdSense program, though David can correct me if I&#8217;m wrong) when you type a domain that isn&#8217;t resolving temporarily or doesn&#8217;t exist, but they display it on the side. And, the key difference is, they don&#8217;t do it for typos like the mentioned &#8220;digg.xom&#8221; so I see no conflict here.</p>
<p>OpenDNS is providing a great service &#8211; and one users have made a conscious decision to set up, unlike Google&#8217;s installation of seemingly harmlessly named browser objects. My only hope is that OpenDNS is already profitable because if they&#8217;re not, I fear what could happen is we may lose this great service if the company doesn&#8217;t have a viable (and by this I mean profitable) business model going forward.</p>
<p>My more-than-two cents. <img src="http://blog.opendns.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Doug</p>
<p>P.S. I remember reading a number of years (that same CNET News.com story, at the time) of Dell and Google&#8217;s new partnership. It seemed so innocuous and I just assumed it was a great way to get the Google Toolbar and Google Web search out front and centre with the pending launch of Windows Vista. They wanted to continue being the default search engine and continuing to serve up relevant ads with great search results to as many people as possible. I never imagined in my wildest dreams they would install such a nasty parasite like GoogleAFE (what does the &#8216;AFE&#8217; stand for anyway?) to grab even *more* revenue by typosquatting. That&#8217;s essentially what they&#8217;re doing &#8211; and the difference between them or a company like Internet REIT, Marchex, Name Media, or Oversee.net &#8211; is they don&#8217;t need to buy any domain names. No expenses. It&#8217;s a cash windfall!</p>

Before I ever saw this thread, the first thing I did with my openDNS account was block google.com.  This is because I am sick and tired  of slaving over firewall rules to try to achieve effective outbound filtering, only to have my logs flooded with message after message to google (sorry, I won&#8217;t capitalize the name of a spyware proliferer).  This after changing all of my default search engines away from google and attempting to remove google from all of the search lists on my machines.  If you don&#8217;t think google uses spyware tactics, you are not filtering outbound traffic, or you are not reading your logs.  And yes, I know I could just drop the google traffic without logging, but once you start dropping logs of traffic that shouldn&#8217;t be there, you are headed for trouble.  There is a reason that google knows more than anyone else about everything, and its not because they are minding their own business.</p>

What&#8217;s even more stupid than DAve&#8217;s experience is that the google re-direction actually stopped me from seeing any websires at all. After my wife searched something on google I typed in a web address. From that point on, the web browser would always add in a google url (<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/hws/sony/afe?hl=en&#038;s=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/hws/sony/afe?hl=en&#038;s=</a>) in front of whatever web page I was trying to access. So if I typed in <a href="http://www.talktalk.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.talktalk.co.uk/</a> it would direct me to<br />
<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/hws/sony/afe?hl=en&#038;s=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/hws/sony/afe?hl=en&#038;s=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/</a>. This is ridiculous, as none of these urls are valid. I never asked to have this stupid pre-fix attached to the urls I type in, I just want to type them in myself. I was able to get rid of it by de-installing the google toolbar and a programme called something like &#8220;google windows&#8221; application.<br />
Bottom line, not only is google installing this re-directing software on pc, but the stupid redirecting software doesn&#8217;t actually re-direct you anywhere.</p>
