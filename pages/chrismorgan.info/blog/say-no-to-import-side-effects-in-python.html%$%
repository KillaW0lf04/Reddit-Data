<p class=summary>When you write Python code, <pretty-please with-sugar-on-top>please</pretty-please> donât have sideâeffects in your module imports.

<p>I must be able to import your moduleâ<em>any</em> moduleâat any time without anything breaking.

<p>Hereâs an example of the type of problem that import sideâeffects causes,<!-- yes, that comma is deliberate! --> on my laptop which has accumulated almost five years of Things of Diverse Character<!-- and Disposition -->:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">help</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;modules&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="go">Please wait a moment while I gather a list of all available modules...</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><span class="go">WARNING: Running on Linux, but cannot use Epoll Twisted reactor.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="go"> =&gt; reactor already installed</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="go">Will let Twisted choose a default reactor (potential performance degradation).</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="go">WARNING:OpenGL.Tk:Expected Tk Togl installation in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/OpenGL/Tk/togl-linux2-64</span><br /><span class="go">/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtk-2.0/gtk/__init__.py:127: RuntimeWarning: PyOS_InputHook is not available for interactive use of PyGTK</span><br /><span class="go">  set_interactive(1)</span><br /><span class="go">[1]    9098 segmentation fault (core dumped)  python</span><br /></pre></div><br />
<p>The first time I ran it today, it took upwards of a minute before it got to the segfault. Immediately after, with a hot cache, it still took almost ten seconds to get thereâthings are simply doing too much at import time.

<p>gdb reveals, by the way, that the segfault is in <code>libQtGui.so.4</code>, because <code>/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/frescobaldi_app/icons/__init__.py</code> saw fit to call <code>QIcon.themeSearchPaths()</code> (with no <code>QApplication</code> set up, which Qt requires), something it flatly shouldnât be doing at import time.

<p>Python has tried to provide a useful feature in <code>help('modules')</code>, but other programmers have scuppered it by their laziness and lack of conformance to Best Practicesâ¢.

<p>Last time I tried <code>help('modules')</code> I didnât have Frescobaldi installed; at that time, some GUI tests of some form ran, so I had a handful of windows popping up about the place briefly. It still crashed somewhere later, canât remember where.

<p>â¦ and it only got that far because I had already removed a piece of code (from rst2pdf, I think it was) which had tests which, were the environment not set up to its satisfaction (specifically, it wanted to be in its source repositoryâthe file was not supposed to have been installed) raised <code>SystemExit</code>.

<p>You see, at that time I wanted to see if I could get <code>help('modules')</code> to work.

<p>I gave up.
