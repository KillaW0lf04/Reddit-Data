<p>Rick Doblin, the founder and president of MAPS, said this in a recent &#8220;Ask Me Anything&#8221; <a href="http://psychedelicfrontier.com/2013/12/ask-me-anything-reddit-interview-with-rick-doblin-maps/" >interview</a>Â on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve just completed the world&#8217;s first study of the therapeutic use of LSD in over 40 years, in Switzerland to treat anxiety associated with end-of-life issues. Eleven of the 12 subjects had never done LSD before and there were no serious adverse events, even in people facing death.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_1940" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 152px"><img class="wp-image-1940" alt="Dr. Peter Gasser, who led the study" src="http://psychedelicfrontier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Peter-Gasser.jpg" width="152" height="183" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Peter Gasser, who led the study</p></div>
<p>This recently completed <a title="LSD Study" href="http://www.maps.org/research/lsd/Gasser-2014-JMND-4March14.pdf" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.maps.org/research/lsd/Gasser-2014-JMND-4March14.pdf']);">Swiss study</a> is truly momentous &#8212; it&#8217;s the <strong>first &#8220;double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of LSD-assisted psychotherapy since the earlyÂ 1970s.</strong>&#8221; This pilot study found that two LSD-assisted psychotherapy sessions successfully reduced anxiety in patients with terminal illnesses.Â The study was led by Peter Gasser, M.D., who wrote aÂ <a href="http://www.maps.org/research/lsd/Gasser_Letter_27May2011.pdf" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.maps.org/research/lsd/Gasser_Letter_27May2011.pdf']);">letter (PDF)</a>Â to friends and colleagues at its completion. In it he writes thatÂ âall the 12 participants reported a benefit from the treatment.â He continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am proud to say that we had in 30 sessions (22 with full dose 200 Î¼g LSD and 8 with placebo dose 20 Î¼g LSD) no severe side effects such as psychotic experiences or suicidal crisis or flashbacks or severe anxieties (bad trips)&#8230;That means that we can show that LSD treatment can be safe when it is done in a carefully controlled clinical setting.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper, which was accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed Â <em>Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease</em>, makes these conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>This pilot study found positive trends in the reduction of anxiety following two LSD-assisted psychotherapy sessions.</li>
<li>Anxiety remained at reduced levels at 12-month follow-up sessions, implying durability of effects.</li>
<li>LSD-assisted psychotherapy can be safely administered in these subjects.</li>
<li>The results of this small pilot study are promising, and should be pursued in larger samples.</li>
</ul>
<p>Twelve is a very small sample size, but this study is not intended to be conclusive. Rather, it re-establishes LSD as a compound which may be safely administered to human subjects, and opens the door to larger studies in the future. In the current political climate it is difficult to conduct an LSD study of any size, so these results are a tremendous step forward in legitimizing psychedelic research.</p>
<p>A <a title="Pilot Study of Psilocybin Treatment for Anxiety in Patients With Advanced-Stage Cancer" href="http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=210962" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com']);">similar study</a>, published in 2010 by Dr. Charles Grob at UCLA, exploredÂ psilocybin as a treatment for anxiety in advanced cancer patients. That study made similar conclusions about the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in reducing anxiety. Perhaps in the future, people approaching death will have their choice of psychedelic medicines to help ease the stress of the experience.</p>

<h2>Setting and Methodology</h2>
<p>People experienced with psychedelics may react with some skepticism to the setting of the study. Who wants to trip in some drab hospital room or psychology lab, with clinical staff prodding you with Rorschach ink blots and free-association tests? Wouldn&#8217;t a Phish concert or a sunny day in the park be more therapeutic? I have a couple replies to these concerns.</p>
<p>First, consider the subjects. Of the twelve subjects, only one had ever tried LSD before. Most weren&#8217;t naturally drawn to the psychedelic experience for recreational, exploratory, or spiritual reasons. All of them were confronting advanced-stage terminal illnesses, and decided to try an experimental treatment to reduce their persistent anxiety.</p>
<p>If you were in this position, a professionally guided psychedelic therapy session may sound more attractive than tripping for the first time in your house, the woods, or at a concert. No matter how experienced your friends and family are, they probably aren&#8217;t psychotherapists trained to confront death-related anxiety within the framework of psychedelic therapy.</p>
<p>Second, check out Dr. Peter Gasser&#8217;s office where the sessions were conducted. Does this look like a drab and dreary lab to you?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2277" alt="lsd study room" src="http://psychedelicfrontier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lsd-study-room.jpg" width="350" height="223" /></p>
<p>As an organization dedicated to studying the medical benefits of psychedelics, MAPS is well aware of the crucial importance of set and setting. In this study, the subject would lie down on the soft mattress pictured above.Â Music was played during some parts of the sessions, but other parts were silent. The researchers made every effort to keep subjects comfortable and relaxed, and did not pressure them to talk when they were peaking. According to the clinical report:</p>
<blockquote><p>The investigators engaged with the subject, supporting and encouragingÂ emotional processing and resolution of whatever psychological material emerged. If the subjectÂ did not speak spontaneously within the first hour, the investigators checked in with the subject.Â The investigators also encouraged periods of silent introspection to support and increase theÂ psychological insights mediated by the LSD treatment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sessions were conducted by two psychotherapists, one male and one female. Each subject received two blinded LSD sessions, either with 200 Î¼g, the active dose, or an &#8220;active placebo&#8221; ofÂ 20 Î¼g. These sessions wereÂ &#8220;embedded within aÂ course of six to eight individual non-drug psychotherapy sessions that prepared subjects for LSD-assistedÂ therapy and then helped subjects integrate material from the LSD-assisted sessions.&#8221; No strange men in white coats, then; subjects were familiar with their therapists before the LSD sessions, and were helped to process and integrate their experiences afterwards.</p>
<p>After a long hiatus, this promising study should pave the way to continued interest and research regarding psychedelic-assisted therapy.

<p>There&#8217;s a book called Acid Dreams you should check out if you&#8217;re interested. It talks about everything, starting with Hoffman, through the MK-Ultra trials, Milbrook, the Hashbury, all of it. Very informative.</p>

<p>Also, primal regression under the influence of LSD can be very dangerous in an adult human.  Go read the logs of the early LSD trials with traumatized children and consider what would happen if a 6&#8217;3&#8243; male acted like that while in the grips of the drug.</p>

And just for anyone in this particular thread, I think there&#8217;s an accidental miscommunication between some of the comments.  I think that somewhere there was some confusion between &#8220;flashback,&#8221; which typically happen after the process as some of the chemicals do stay in your system for some time (especially if the product is cut and impure you can have some really nasty stuff left.) An active hallucination during the experience, (which I think some people are referring to as a flashback?) and the traditional term of &#8220;flashback,&#8221; which would be the reference to PTSD type that soldiers experience.  I think this lack of definition may be causing some difficulties with the flow of communication.</p>
<p>But &#8220;Lawabidingcitizen&#8221; is still an ignorant jackass that&#8217;s spouting off about things he is extremely ignorant about. As I suspect I know what &#8220;research,&#8221; you&#8217;re referring to, which has essentially been discredited, and is out of date. The best argument against, (which most qualified people discredit,) would be that the drug itself does not cause post regressive hallucinations (or however you want to call a flashback without actually calling it that,) are caused by the drug triggering other already present mental or cognitive disorders in susceptible, or already prone people. Very few to no credible people in the field would say that flashbacks, or something extremely like flashbacks is very real.  I would bey my psychology degree, experiences with several renown professors, field experience, documented experience in others, and first hand experience on it. But hey, what do I know compared to what appears to be a twenty something, affliction shirt wearing guy who&#8217;s best argument is referring to other people as &#8220;goddamn&#8217;ed liars,&#8221; on the internet.</p>

A simple search can shed light on the claims, but as for additional personal experiences, I don&#8217;t think it appropriate to cite personal experiences shared in confidence, or to cite discussions with professors or psychologists on the internet, without prior consent. Chances are neither of them would really mean anything unless you happen to really like to real clinical psychology books on brain and behavior, or abnormal psychology for fun.</p>

I&#8217;m interested in the use and study of psychedelic drugs from a laymans perspective, it helps if their is a buffer between me and 10000 page books that I am never going to read..<br />
I&#8217;ve had personal experiances and they main effect they have had on me is helped me realise that I know nothing about almost everything and the most effective way for me to learn is this way.<br />

Even the name &#8220;flash back&#8221; indicates this. I would be surprised if many people confused it with hallucinations that occur with an active dose. </p>
<p>Also, while the phenomenon of flashbacks is not well understood, it is most certainly not because &#8220;the chemicals do stay in your system for some time.&#8221; As I&#8217;m sure you know, LSD and other psychedelics are fully metabolized just like alcohol, nicotine, and pharmaceuticals. People have experienced flashbacks months or even years after their last active dose, when there is zero psychoactive material left in their body. It is much more likely, in my opinion, that it is an endogenous psychological phenomenon, perhaps akin to the flashbacks associated with PTSD that you mention.</p>

You specifically said that the active component is eliminated before the trip is over, indicating that the mind has the capacity to experience the LSD trip even in the absence of the drug.</p>
<p>Is it really so impossible that the brain could temporarily re-create some aspects of a psychedelic trip later on? I don&#8217;t think anyone is claiming that they experienced a full-on psychedelic trip for 10 hours without any drugs, years after the original experience. Most reports that I hear are far more transient and limited, which makes sense if the brain is only simulating aspects of a trip.</p>
<p>Traumatized individuals experience flashbacks without drugs. Perhaps the psychedelic flashbacks that people experience are similar in nature to PTSD flashbacks &#8212; revisiting a memory so intense that it rekindles the experience.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-250" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Well, to be fair I did say mostly. They are mostly eliminated, but the chemical being mostly eliminated causes a lowered intensity in the trip. LSD is quite strong for about 5 hours, and then it tails off for the next 7 or so. As for the relation to PTSD, I don&#8217;t think so. PTSD is triggered by a traumatic event that actually &#8220;damages the hard drive&#8221;, to make use of psychological phraseology. The brain&#8217;s structure is actually altered in patients that have PTSD, in that their hippocampus is damaged, and this is thought to cause the symptoms that are seen in PTSD patients. LSD has not been shown to have such an action. Our perception is very altered, but the mechanisms by which the two states of mind come about are completely different. I agree that the way we think can be altered by LSD, but this doesn&#8217;t point toward an actual altering of the physical structure of the brain. I would be interested in hearing about the &#8220;transient and limited&#8221; experiences you&#8217;re talking about, though. Perhaps my understanding of flashback is incorrect. I don&#8217;t think people have full blown psychedelic trips, or even lighter experiences. I could see psychs causing anxiety, but that is much different than a flashback. I&#8217;m only guessing as to what you mean at this point, though. I&#8217;d love to hear more about what you mean exactly.</p>

The point I am making with my comments about structure,is that without differentiation in structure in post and pre LSD brains, as well as having no residual psychoactive chemicals present in the post LSD brain, there simply isn&#8217;t a way for flashbacks to manifest. I&#8217;m glad to hear about LSD opening your mind, though. It&#8217;s a beautiful chemical.</p>

LSD doesn&#8217;t stay in your system after you take it, and it doesn&#8217;t alter your brain structure in any way, so it would be impossible to have a flashback from it. Let me guess, someone popped your back and you started tripping again. Lol</p>

Everything we think and experience has an effect on our neurology, and a strong psychedelic trip can leave a very lasting impression on one&#8217;s personality and perspective.</p>
<p>And the existence of HPPD and dreaming &#8212; both of which occur without drugs in the body, and can cause very strange perceptions &#8212; should lead us not to dismiss flashbacks so casually. Just because we don&#8217;t understand a phenomenon doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t real.</p>

However, like drug tolerance, there are probably some people who just don&#8217;t have it happen, regardless of potency or frequency of use.  I have taken a lot of acid, I believe that I can tell the difference between d-LSD and l-LSD.  I guess what you need to ask yourself is, have you even taken enough to know?  Damien below is right in being unconfident with himself.  &#8220;Perma-tripping&#8221; or &#8220;flashbacks&#8221; in the sense that they are portrayed in the media are not real, those are fake; however, I live with flashbacks everyday, but I continue to contribute to them&#8230; and I like it, like it, love it!  The point is, don;t listen to the media, but do understand how the drugs you are taking work, at least some what; if you did understand that, you would&#8217;t be calling anyone a &#8220;goddamned liar,&#8221; but yourself, for pretending to know something which you did not.</p>

What you did was the punishment for being an idiot. Natural selection and such.<br />
As long as you learned from it, it was clearly a good thing. If you didnât learn from it, and so your chances of survival lowered, that was also a good thing.<br />
The only problem here is that itâs rather normal to be an âidiotâ when being young. I mean thatâs kinda the definition. Nobody is born knowing that stuff.<br />
So your parents should have helped you with that. But like by far the most parents, they probably massively failed at that. Which isnât even their fault. In our society where school is by definition epic shit, where nobody teaches even you how to be a parent (but hey, curve sketching is apparently *key* to survival), and where both parents are forced into life-sucking jobs, who the hell can even raise any kids (anymore)?</p>
<p>Thatâs the real reason for your experience. Not just LSD.<br />
Otherwise you could blame the knife for cutting yourself.</p>

I know you have had visuals where you can draw a graph perfectly and see things with precision, without having to ACTUALLY draw them; although to trip, you do not need to understand how math works, though I have gotten a considerable amount of further enlightenment understanding math.  Have you ever bowled tripping?  I am terrible at bowling, pretty much the worst ever and I nearly got a turkey when I was tripping (I would&#8217;ve got it if not for the 3 pitchers of beer I drank ; ).  I believe this is because of the brain&#8217;s ability to break everything down into the mathematical binary fractal that it is, making you SEE math, feel math, and be math.  My point is that I agree with you, school does teach many stupid things, but learning how math works by using a visual representation of a graph (in a curve) is far from being one of those bad things.  </p>
<p>  Your point about survival is crude, but when isn&#8217;t natural selection crude, is that not the idea?  I agree with you, even as rude/crude as it may seem, he was young, and because his parents could not directly pass down information that they do not know, he could not learn information that they may have known if they had taken LSD and, therefore, he freaked.<br />
   In conclusion, I guess what I am saying is that today&#8217;s parents need to take LSD so that their children also know how to take LSD.  Honestly though, this goes for any drug, if a parent has taken, and survived through a drug discourse or drug addiction, they can then make their child more suitable to take on such a situation.  Oh wait, this goes for learning in general doesn&#8217;t it now?  The more you know and learn, the more you can pass on to your child via teaching, and teaching, by the criteria of Caro and Hauser, will cause the child to learn faster than on their own.<br />
    Kids, stay away from acid, parents, take acid so that you can pass the knowledge gained unto your children!  Flashbacks are real, but like life, they are what you make of them.  I am 26 (almost 27 ha!) and I have been taking acid since age 18.  It has helped me, a scientifically naive, but worldly creative person get a degree in biomedical science.  I don&#8217;t care about the degree, but without acid, I never would&#8217;ve FULLY understood the topics at hand, i.e. physics, math, chemistry, it&#8217;s all so damned easy, right?</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-225" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I would still use flashbacks for rare and transient events, and the term HPPD for truly persistent visions. A person with one or two flashbacks in life is a far cry from HPPD. But as you point out there are cases where the distinction may be arbitrary.</p>
<p>I agree completely with your comments about context. Unfortunately we live in a culture that quickly demonizes aberrant mental activity as a &#8220;disease&#8221; and hurries to &#8220;treat&#8221; it, often with heaps of drugs and social isolation in the form of institutionalization.</p>
<p>For many people, hearing voices or seeing visions may be perfectly healthy, and the best course of treatment is to integrate these perceptions rather than suppress them. But try telling that to modern Western medical practitioners.</p>

One day, some idiot (psychologist) did a few visual tests and told me it was a disorder, called HPPD, and I should stop doing drugs immediately. The psychologist made it sound pretty effing bad, resulting in me turning into a complete paranoid nut job for weeks. I thought it would lead to schizophrenia, blindness, general craziness .etc The visuals would get worse the more I thought about them and the more I tried to focus on them in an agitated state.<br />
So here I was one month previously, healthy and never bored (If I ever got bored, I could just stare at a blank wall and have my own laser show). Then one diagnosis later, I was a paranoid nut job and one very scared individual.<br />
I never took medication for HPPD.<br />
So to come to a hasty conclusion, the diagnosis was the cause of my anxiety and paranoia.<br />
Once I realized that my fear and anxiety was irrational, stress levels went down, I would stop obsessing about the visuals, and eventually I wouldn&#8217;t even notice them. When I was confident again I would start playing with them, soon they would only come back when I wanted them too (Or whenever I would get bored).<br />
To this day I still use LSD and MDMA every so often, can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve noticed any decline or increase in visuals at all.<br />
HPPD is a fucking joke. Just another excuse to score some happy pills and give drug use a bad name IMO<br />
I see it as a gift!</p>

I had friends who took LSD. And while most of that was positive, they definitely had bad trips. And one even got âstuckâ. Something âbrokeâ and heâs now somebody else we donât know.<br />
What they found that itâs key what youâre thinking about while taking it and what happens in reality after that. If youâre in a bad mood, thinking about bad things, and have no guideâ¦ or if somebody just bursts through the door, suprises you or you otherwise experience something unexpected and negativeâ¦ things will be bad. Really bad. Like a nightmare that became real. And that may stay forever if youâre really unlucky.<br />
But yeah, even too much water can kill. Everything has risks. If one does it right, the risks are really overblown. But nowadays itâs somehow âinâ, to assume everyone is a total moron until he actually is one. I donât share that sentiment. We managed to get to the moon. We soft-landed a robot on mars. I *think* we can handle a bit of LSD, if we really want to. :)</p>

This is nothing new and surely not surprising.  Keep in mind that the users are taking lsd in a controlled and therapeutic environment. That is a huge reason this is effective.  In most cases, lsd is administered for recreational purposes in the wrong setting under the wrong circumstances, and something as powerful as this needs precaution and preparation for it&#8217;s benefits to be advantageous.</p>

It is metabolized and excreted in urine pretty rapidly, and there is no reason to believe that flashbacks are caused by psychoactive compounds stored in the body.</p>

I recently watch a doc about a man that was using psychedelic mushrooms as a way to help people get over their addiction to heroin. Everyone that used the treatment came off the heroin. Then the government outlawed his program.<br />
This shows me two things first they dont like the fact people my open their minds and actually think for themselves and see through all the smokescreens they put in place and see the world for how it really is.<br />
secondly they dont really want people using alternative medicine to kick the habit because they will loose out on too much revenue</p>

<p>I would like to see this study take the next step. LSD vs. Mushrooms. A chemical made by the hands of man vs. fungus made by nature. The major difference being the hands of man. The depth you can go with both is tremendous but they are different. With LSD I found that same center but at the very core energies seemed to almost possess vs. mushrooms and energies that seemed to teach a lot more. LSD is a great tool when used as such and for introspection. Same with mushrooms. But there is a vast difference between the two and how energy is absorbed and radiated when utilizing them for clarity in ones own life or self or both.</p>

LSD is just half of the therapy. Without the actual neuro-psychotherapist making sure you donât start out in the wrong mood, keeping you on track, and creating the simulated environments to *properly* regress and retrain, you are more likely to end up âstuckâ or having even stronger traumata than before!<br />
To say this is because of LSD is *massively* misleading.<br />
LSD is an important key factor to improve the learning rate (indirectly). It shortens the time it takes from months to days. And thatâs great. But donât mistake it for a magic pill.</p>

But I think the study makes it clear that LSD-assisted psychotherapy, and not LSD alone, is the key to these results. LSD may not be a magic pill, but as you mention, one can accomplish more with a single LSD-assisted session than months of traditional psychotherapy. That&#8217;s monumental, and it is because of LSD.</p>
<p>Same with MDMA and psilocybin &#8212; they may not be magic, but a single therapeutic session appears to be dramatically more effective than any other medicine we have. This is a major advance in psychiatry.</p>

 Flashback is actually a good term, because it was simply the result of a<br />
 regular life experience that strongly reminded of the mental state of<br />
LSD.  I didn&#8217;t suddenly start tripping and go off the deep end.   The mind doesn&#8217;t need as much help recalling a powerful, visceral experience, which is what I believe was happening.   </p>
<p>As far as &#8216;bad&#8217; trips go, I was once very &#8216;stuck in the loop&#8217; on a high dose and basically sat with my eyes closed for over four hours.  If I had let anxiety take hold of me it could have been bad, however the simple knowledge that I was on a drug was enough to kill any kind &#8216;magical&#8217; anxious thought.  In all honesty, the experience was more boring than anything because I had to sit and wait.   I also know that the primary reason for this &#8216;bad&#8217; trip was because I was with a group that I mostly didn&#8217;t know well, and I was afraid of opening up to them.</p>

<p>Psychedelics are indeed an evolutionary and therapeutic tool &#8211; when used as a &#8216;drug&#8217; all the bad stuff happens and deservedly so.  We are not yet ready for planetary dosing.</p>

Personally, I had the worst experience one can have one week &#8211; followed by the best a week later at the age of 19 &#8211; 35 years ago.  It can take you to the darkest most painful &#8216;place&#8217; in the universe &#8211; and then to the lightest, most blissful. </p>
<p>My two cents worth &#8211;  It should be used as a tool to show you our innate possibilities for higher consciousness.  Once seen &#8211; the idea then is to experience and maintain  awareness naturally.</p>

<p>intends to collect the perspectives of philosophy for better understanding of the human </p>
<p>consciousness,</p>
<p> Eugene Seaich attempts to dissect the human consciousness to </p>
<p>provoke and enlighten the readersâ mind in The Far-Off Land, a revealing book that presents a philosophical </p>
<p>evaluation of the hallucinogenic drug-experience.</p>
<p>This book is a cerebral piece of literature that attempts to discover the broader realities that lie behind </p>
<p>psychogenic phenomena and seek a pattern that will explain the longing of human being for the Beyond, for the </p>
<p>otherworldly substance of their intuition. Seaich will take readers on a trip through millennia, offer them </p>
<p>glimpses of the forthcoming and explore deeper his own psycheâand experiences with LSD and mescalineâin </p>
<p>order for them to discover a more profound and broader understanding of the mind and human consciousness. </p>
<p>Guided by a cardinal principle, Seaich captures the philosophical prospects and covers a great background of </p>
<p>other relevant fields of study that promote psychotropic knowledge to better understand human consciousnessâ</p>
<p>and to ultimately improve humanityâs cure to mental illness and even solve lifeâs mysteries.</p>
<p>Filled with tremendous meaning and insight, revelations and wisdom, historical facts and quotes from the </p>
<p>worldâs greatest minds and literature, The Far-Off Land is an intelligent and poetic prose that will inform </p>
<p>readers about human consciousness and inspire them about life, including its complexities, a journey full of </p>
<p>realizations and value.</p>
<p>Now available</p>
<p> An attempt at a philosophical evaluation of the hallucinogenic drug experience.</p>
