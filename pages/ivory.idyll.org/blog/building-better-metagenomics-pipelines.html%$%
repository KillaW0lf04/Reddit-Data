        <p>I spend <em>so much</em> of my time writing stuff down to cadge funding or
bruit about ideas, and much of that never really goes anywhere.
In the interests of slowing down any competitors by getting them
to take my old ideas seriously, here is an <em>interesting</em> set of
ideas that I wrote up a few months ago with one particular funding
body in mind.</p>
<p>I would welcome comments by scientists on whether or not the social
ideas, below, would actually work.  Remember, this is in the context
of &quot;no do-ey, no fund-ey&quot;.</p>
<p>(Basically, I'm trying to hack scientific culture the way <a class="reference external" href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4564">ESR talks
about hacking software culture</a>.
See <a class="reference external" href="static/w4s-overview.html">my more general thoughts</a> on this, too.)</p>
<div class="section" id="technology">
<h2>Technology:</h2>
<p>We and others have a number of solutions that need to be carefully
implemented with attention to both biological correctness and scale.
Some specific ideas:</p>
<p>1) Methods for integrating metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data and
eventually metaproteomic data, to identify and annotate genes.  The
goal is to enable the robust comparison of gene expression across
conditions and environments.</p>
<p>The digital normalization approach developed by my lab allows us to
combine both metagenome and metatranscriptome data from many different
conditions for a maximally sensitive global assembly.  Following this
assembly we can then recover differentially expressed genes by looking
at transcriptional levels in specific samples.</p>
<p>2) Correlation and difference analysis of large metagenomic data
sets. Specifically, enable us to query for presence/absence/abundance
across metagenomic and metatranscriptomic shotgun data sets from a
vast (1000s-100s of 1000s) number of samples, and extract gene
presence/absence and expression level profiles from that data.  Our
lab has developed the ability to do this very sensitively at the
genomic level, which would be a nice complement to protein-based
techniques.</p>
<p>For example, we can see a ~50% genomic overlap between the raw reads
from Iowa prairie and Iowa corn soil samples, indicating that a
substantial portion of the underlying genomes are shared.  This is a
general approach that would let us compare and contrast microbial
communities without passaging data through the very biased filter of
assembly.</p>
<p>The underlying technology already exists, but scaling it up so that we
can do ongoing comparisons of thousands or (eventually) millions of
samples, and providing a flexible query system on top of it, is a
significant challenge.</p>
<p>3) Assembly-graph-based exploration of complex data sets.  It is quite
likely that we are failing to assemble highly variable regions from
complex metagenomes, and it should be straightforward to use
partitioning to isolate, detect and analyze such regions.</p>
<p>4) Annotation evaluation.  Virtually everyone expresses frustration
with the current genome annotation pipelines.  I propose to develop
methods for evaluating annotations for environmental (meta)genomes so
that annotation pipelines and assembly strategies can be compared more
objectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="social-aspects">
<h2>Social aspects:</h2>
<p>The human aspect is as important as functioning technology, I think,
and to address failings with existing metagenome pipelines, I would
suggest the following &quot;cross cutting&quot; efforts:</p>
<p>1) Develop all software in tight collaboration with labs who already
have data and are attempting to answer specific biological problems;
this ensures that the software is relevant.  <em>(Details of current
collaborations omitted.)</em></p>
<p>2) Implement everything as open source software, with installation
instructions for the cloud, and with a simple Galaxy Web interface on
top, with cloud execution capability.  (This is the model we√ïre using
for our current khmer software.)</p>
<p>This addresses a number of problems with the way current software
pipelines in metagenomics are written: first, we can provide a
standalone, tested, published, and compartmentalized workflow
component that can be reused by technically savvy individuals as well
as big workflow engines (e.g. MG-RAST and kbase).  This answers the
concern that much of pipeline software is ad hoc and untested in
isolation. Second, we provide a simple Web interface that lets less
technically capable people use the software with predefined
parameters.  This enables scientists to work with the software in
standalone mode.  And third, the component can be executed locally (on
e.g. HPC systems), via a public or private pipeline (e.g. MG-RAST), or
directly on rental compute (the Amazon cloud), which provides the
broadest possible set of options for Cyberinfrastructure use.</p>
<p>3) Provide training through targeted workshops on environmental
metagenomics.  I run an in-depth workshop on general NGS data analysis
during the summer, and feedback from that course has been very
positive: students report that they are much more capable after the
fact. (See <a class="reference external" href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/ngs-2012-course.html">http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/ngs-2012-course.html</a> for a
writeup).  Last year I participated in the STAMPS course at MBL which
had a combined 16s+shotgun focus.</p>
<p>I would propose to run a more targeted ~1 week workshop on
environmental shotgun metagenomics using Illumina and other &quot;deep
sampling&quot; strategies, organized along the lines of the NGS summer
course.</p>
