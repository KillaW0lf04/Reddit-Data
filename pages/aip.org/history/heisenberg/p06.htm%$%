<TD><FONT SIZE=+3>H</FONT><FONT SIZE=+2>eisenberg returned to Munich</FONT>
from G&ouml;ttingen, where he had been a visiting student, in May 1923
to finish out his last semester while writing his doctoral dissertation.
Knowing Heisenberg's reputation for controversial solutions to problems
in quantum theory, his Munich mentor, Arnold Sommerfeld, suggested that
he write his dissertation in the more traditional field of hydrodynamics.
Heisenberg also had to take the four-hour laboratory course in experimental
physics offered by Prof. Wilhelm Wien. Wien insisted that any physicist,
even Sommerfeld's brilliant theorists, must be fully prepared in experimental
physics. Physics in those days still meant primarily experimental physics.
Theoretical physics, though rising in status, had not yet reached full
acceptance as a branch of physics equal to experimental research. Wien
and Sommerfeld both sat on the candidate's final oral exam and both had
to agree on a single grade in physics.</TD>

<TD><FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><FONT SIZE=+2>hile Heisenberg struggled</FONT>
through Wien's lab course (much to Wien's displeasure at the results),
he prepared his dissertation. He submitted the work, a 59-page calculation
titled &quot;On the Stability and Turbulence of Fluid Flow,&quot; to the
Munich faculty on July 10, 1923. The topic arose from an earlier research
contract Sommerfeld had received from a company channeling the Isar River
through Munich. The problem was to determine the precise transition of
a smoothly flowing fluid (laminar flow) to turbulent flow. It was an extremely
difficult mathematical problem; in fact, it was so difficult that Heisenberg
offered only an approximate solution. &quot;I would not have proposed a
topic of this difficulty as a dissertation to any of my other pupils,&quot;
wrote Sommerfeld. The faculty accepted the thesis and Wien accepted it
for publication in the physics journal he edited (<I>Annalen der Physik</I>).
When the mathematician Fritz Noether raised objections to the results in
1926,&nbsp; they remained in doubt for nearly a quarter century until they
were finally confirmed. </TD>

of the dissertation brought admission of the candidate to the final orals.
The examining committee consisted of Sommerfeld and Wien in physics, along
with representatives in Heisenberg's two minor subjects, mathematics and
astronomy. Much was at stake, for the only grades a candidate received
for his studies were those based on the dissertation and final oral: one
grade for each subject and one for overall performance. The grades ranged
from I (equivalent to an A) to V (an F). </TD>

appeared before the four professors on July 23, 1923, he easily handled
Sommerfeld's questions and those in mathematics, but he began to stumble
on astronomy and fell flat on his face on experimental physics. In his
laboratory work Heisenberg had to use a Fabry-Perot interferometer, a device
for observing the interference of light waves, which the class had studied
extensively. But Heisenberg had no idea how to derive the resolving power
of the interferometer nor, to Wien's surprise, could he derive the resolution
(ability to distinguish objects) of such common instruments as the telescope
or the microscope. When an angry Wien asked him how a storage battery works,
the candidate was still lost. Wien saw no reason to pass the young man,
no matter how brilliant he might be in other branches of physics. An argument
arose between Sommerfeld and Wien over the relative importance of&nbsp;
theoretical physics in relation to experimental physics. The result was
that Heisenberg received a III, equivalent to a C, in physics and for the
overall grade for his doctorate.&nbsp; Both of these grades were probably
averages between Sommerfeld's grade (an A) and Wien's grade (an F). </TD>

<TD><FONT SIZE=+3>S</FONT><FONT SIZE=+2>ommerfeld was shocked.</FONT> Heisenberg
was mortified. Accustomed to being always at the top of his class, Heisenberg
found it hard to accept a mediocre grade for his doctorate. Sommerfeld
held a small party at his home later that evening for the new Dr. Heisenberg,
but Heisenberg excused himself early, packed his bag, and took the midnight
train to G&ouml;ttingen, showing up in Max Born's office the next morning.
Born had already hired Heisenberg as his teaching assistant for the coming
school year. After informing Born of the debacle of his orals, Heisenberg
asked sheepishly, &quot;I wonder if you still want to have me.&quot; </TD>

that the questions were &quot;rather tricky,&quot; Born let his employment
offer stand. But that fall Heisenberg's worried father wrote to the famed
G&ouml;ttingen experimentalist James Franck, asking Franck to teach his
boy some experimental physics. Franck did his best, but he could not overcome
Heisenberg's complete lack of interest and gave up the effort. If Heisenberg
was going to survive at all in physics it would be only as a theorist.
