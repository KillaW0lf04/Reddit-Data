<blockquote><p>&#8220;On Jan. 18, special agents with ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations and local authorities briefly interviewed a man suspected of using an electronic recording device to record a film at an AMC theater in Columbus.  The man, who voluntarily answered questions, confirmed to authorities that the suspected recording device was also a pair of prescription eye glasses in which the recording function had been inactive. No further action was taken.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Love it or hate it,   <!--SHR --><a href='http://phandroid.com/google-glass/' target='_blank'>Google Glass</a><!-- EHR --> has been the cause for a lot of excitement lately. Last week it was <a href="http://phandroid.com/2014/01/16/google-glass-driving-legal-or-illegal/">pronounced legal to wear but not use while driving</a> in the state of California. Shortly after, Glass was making waves again with the launch of an app called &#8220;<a href="http://phandroid.com/2014/01/17/sex-with-glass-glassware-nsfw/">Sex with Glass</a>&#8220;, allowing participants to essentially create their own sex tapes with the facial tech. Apparently, the FBI felt left out of all the fun.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-132666 alignleft colorbox-132664" alt="Screen Shot 2014-01-20 at 6.01.05 PM" src="http://phandroid.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-20-at-6.01.05-PM.png" width="383" height="251" />At an AMC theater in Easton Mall in Columbus, Ohio, one Google Glass Explorer went to see Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, but got a rude awakening instead. An hour into the movie he was approached by a federal agent who, without hesitation, snatched the Google Glass off the man&#8217;s face and removed him from the theater.</p>
<p>Outside there were 5 to 10 officers and agents who proceeded to allegedly badger and question him for over 3 hours, suggesting he was illegally recording the movie. Let&#8217;s get a few facts out of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s probably not smart to bring a recording device into a movie theater, but let&#8217;s not forget mostly everyone takes a mobile phone into a theater that is perfectly capable of recording</li>
<li>The man&#8217;s Google Glass were the prescription version, so he essentially needed them on to see the movie (maybe he should have worn other glasses)</li>
<li>The man had his Google Glass powered off in advance to avoid any misunderstandings</li>
</ul>
<p>The authorities eventually let the man go, but not without hours of intimidation and a frightening story that has him shaking &#8211; literally &#8211; even a day after the event. A Movie Association representative compensated the Glass Explorer with 2 free movie tickets for his night of troubles.</p>
<p>The authorities certainly have the right to remove a patron from the theater suspected of recording the screen, but should wearing Google Glass be suspicion enough? The Explorer cooperated with the authorities, but considering his rights and his innocence, would you have acted differently or pursued a better outcome?</p>
<p>As Google Glass and other wearable tech become more prevalent, you can bet we&#8217;ll hear a lot more of these stories popping up across the world.</p>
<p>Read our full <a href="http://phandroid.com/2013/05/09/google-glass-review/">Google Glass Review</a> and discuss <a href="http://androidforums.com/google-glass/">Google Glass on  Android Forums</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <em>We&#8217;ve been in touch with the subject of this story and received some additional information, shared below, although the man has asked to remain anonymous.</em></p>
<p>Asked whether or not his Google Glass were damaged in the process:</p>
<blockquote><p>My glasses were not damaged. After I explained to them how much they cost, they touched them in a gentler way. The only rough part was when they took them off my face in the theater.</p></blockquote>
<p>Asked how other movie-goers reacted:</p>
<blockquote><p>People around me were all looking in my direction. Being dark in the theatre, I didn&#8217;t see how the other people react. And it happened rather fast. I followed my glasses &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t let somebody just take them and leave without me following.</p></blockquote>
<p>Asked if  he could confirm the identities and/or organization of the officers:</p>
<blockquote><p>I didn&#8217;t get the contact information for the officers. I was too shaken to remember the names, and I didn&#8217;t ask for business cards. The IDs they showed me looked legit &#8211; but what do I know?</p>
<p>The guy that said he represented the Movie Association gave me his business card, which I photographed with my phone and gave back, as I do with all business cards that are given to me (I am very good at losing little pieces of paper). I wrote him an email today (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">EMAIL ADDRESS REDACTED</span>) asking him for the names of the federal agents and he didn&#8217;t reply<br />
yet.</p>
<p>I also tried a different avenue. Until April of last year I worked at (REDACTED) where I have been in contact with an<br />
agent from the bureau from the internet crimes division (NAME REDACTED), and I asked him to help me find out his colleagues names. He asked me so far if I am sure they were the FBI, or maybe DHS, Columbus PD or RIAA, and all I could do was to describe their IDs (they looked white with two horizontal light blue stripes on them).</p>
<p>I expect (REDACTED) will help me, and when I find their names I will probably file a complaint with their supervisors. My wife told me that while I was in the room with the two officers, she was in another room where nobody paid any attention to her and a long-haired guy that apparently was in the movie theater with us was talking to two cops about how is it to<br />
be &#8220;under cover&#8221;.</p>
<p>From what (REDACTED) said, they were having known issues on that theatre, and they had suspicions there would be attempts to pirate that particular movie. Columbus is not a big city, and I think it was about an hour after the movie started until they snatched me out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Asked why he didn&#8217;t wear regular glasses that day:</p>
<blockquote><p>After I got my prescription lens for Glass, I wore Google Glass exclusively, including at the movies. As the prior couple of times there was no issue with me wearing glass at the very same movie theater, I didn&#8217;t even think about wearing my old pair of glasses to the movie, and I didn&#8217;t have my old glasses with me.</p>
<p>I always carry an &#8220;emergency pair&#8221; in my car, but the car was in the parking lot. So the short answer is no, i didn&#8217;t consider wearing regular glasses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Asked if this experience will change the way he wears Glass or handles authorities that approach him about the use of Glass:</p>
<blockquote><p>This experience doesn&#8217;t change the way I wear Glass. I will just have another pair with me when I am going to the movies.</p>
<p>In the event somebody else shoves a badge in my face in the future (not in a traffic situation), my plan is to say &#8220;lawyer&#8221; and then nothing else. If I am in a traffic situation I plan to just be polite, and if the traffic officer decides to give me a ticket for wearing Glass I plan to fight it in court.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then insisted he never wanted to make a big deal about this, simply wanting to warn fellow Glass Explorers about his experience and how they might learn from it. He topped it off with a rather interesting observation about the &#8220;fear&#8221; of new technology and how perceptions change over time:</p>
<blockquote><p>I still remember the days when people didn&#8217;t want to put pictures of themselves on the Internet, and now that&#8217;s all there is on the internet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget about all those 6-second Vines and animated GIFs.</p>

Has nothing to do if you&#8217;re injured or felt pain.  Taking the glasses off his face is assault and battery.  Being on private properity where that properity which is allowing customers to occupy is not the same as crossing somebodies properity for no reason and without permission.  Do I think the movie theater has the right to refuse entrance to someone with Google Glasses, yes.  Do they have a right to grab you and take the glasses off without asking, no.  To be honest if I had a restuarant or something with a gathering, I wouldn&#8217;t allow them on while coming in, I would politely ask them to be removed, and it can go on from there.</p>
<p>Not sure how true this story is or not is another question.  Nor am I a fan of Google Glasses as well as this sense of entitlement people think they have with these gimmicks.  But it doesn&#8217;t make allegedly what happens right.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-788512" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Some tips that may help in many tricky situations:</p>
<p>GENERAL RIGHTS YOU SHOULD ALWAYS KNOW:</p>
<p>You have the right to remain silent<br />
You have the right to an attorney<br />
You have a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination<br />
You have a First Amendment right to freedom of speech<br />
You have a Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures</p>
<p>QUESTIONING BY “AUTHORITIES”<br />
If you are stopped by police, FBI, or other governmental “authorities,” remember your rights listed above, as well as these helpful hints:</p>
<p>Ask, “Am I being detained?” If the ‘authority’ says, “No,” then move on. You do not have to speak to them if you are not being detained. Do not allow them to trick you into speaking. For example, you may ask if you are being detained, and the authority may respond, “Not technically; I just want to ask you something,” or they may avoid the question completely. The best thing to do in this situation is to keep walking. Tell them that you do not wish to speak to them and that you are invoking your right to remain silent.</p>
<p>If an authority answers that you are being detained, remember that you still have the right to remain silent. They may ask for your name, social security number, address and phone. You do not have to provide this information. However, if you are subsequently arrested, you will waste a lot of time if you do not give your name and address, because they will hold you until they get it. If you don’t want to wait, the ONLY INFORMATION YOU HAVE TO GIVE IS YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS. You do not have to provide your phone number or social security number. (Note: there has been much debate over this issue. Some cases say that you must provide identification when lawfully detained, or you can be arrested for interfering with the duties of an officer. When in doubt, try to call your attorney, as many cases are fact specific.)</p>
<p>Just because you are being detained, does not mean you will be arrested.</p>
<p>Activists are routinely followed to their cars after protests. The best thing to do in this situation is keep walking and do not allow the ‘authority’ to follow you to you car and into your personal life.</p>

Since the person in this case was obviously wearing a recording device, they have enough probable cause to let him sit in a cell until they obtained a warrant to search through the device. It is in your best interest to fully cooperate with them, especially if you are not guilty of anything. By not cooperating you just make the process longer and harder for yourself. You can obviously go ahead and exercise your rights listed above, but they are only really helpful if you are actually guilty of something.</p>

Even if you know you are 100% innocent, all it takes is one mistake in your recollection of events (and many things can affect how one remembers something) for things to go south for you. I believe the example the lecturer gave was that a man was asked where he was at a specific time and date a while after the crime occurred. He said he was one place, but the cops caught him on camera somewhere else. I think he ended up getting convicted, and then later proven innocent. All because he was cooperating with police.</p>

There is nothing a cop can say that validates his &#8216;need&#8217; to violate the rights of others based ONLY on his feelings. If the SHEEP stop taking the abuse, and start FORCING these retarded NAZIS to actually go through PROPER CHANNELS before causing injury to a citizen by means of illegal arrests and phony or fabricated charges, you SUE THEM PERSONALLY, and MAKE them suffer for their crimes against US. STOP playing SHEEP, these bastards are using YOUR money to assault you, how INSANE is THAT?<br />
Paying to be assaulted by your own employees should be CRIMINAL at the very least!</p>

There is no maybe, he should not have worn Glass into a movie theater.  I&#8217;m not a fan of how the situation was handled, but it isn&#8217;t terribly surprising.  He had a recording device pointed at the screen during the movie which is pretty clearly not okay.  It&#8217;s like holding up a cell phone during a movie and then being surprised that you get kicked out even though the phone was off.  My guess is that in the near future you&#8217;ll see signs explicitly banning Google Glass, even though they&#8217;re really already banned as a recording device (a phone in a pocket is not the same thing).</p>

People are making it a bigger deal of the recording capabilities that it is.   It&#8217;s not a full camcorder and nor can it record a full movie like a camcorder.   People are being plain silly.   Go ahead and try to record a full movie on glass and see if you can pull it off and it being remotely enjoyable and viewable.   People with authority in this article have too much leverage and power and are completely blowing a situation that could have handled better with some common sense by just going straight to google and see what it can do.

Besides, if you were actually going to record a movie at a theater, you wouldn&#8217;t want to use Glass anyways.  As I hear it (I don&#8217;t have Glass myself), the field of vision for recording is limited (not wide enough for the big screen) and it automatically stops recording after 5 minutes so you&#8217;d have to keep restarting recording.</p>

The &#8220;victim&#8221; was an idiot for wearing Glass into a movie theater. It is very obvious that that thing has a camera and no one is familiar enough with it to know if it is off or on. The FBI agents could have handled it in a more human manor. You know, like saying &#8220;hey are you recording this movie?&#8221; To which the &#8220;victim&#8221; could have replied, &#8220;No, I turned it off before coming in&#8221; as well as showing the agents that it was in fact off. All of that could have been done in 10 minutes. </p>
<p>But instead, like most reported encounters go, the agents/officers assumed the man was guilty. They interrogated him as though he was guilty and attempted to intimidate him like most &#8220;authorities&#8221; do. </p>

Most people have no idea that there is a LED on the Google Glasses to indicate it&#8217;s power state, but a lot of people knows that it has video recording capability, so it&#8217;s definitely suspicious to wear a video recording device on your face while watching a movie. Police have the right to stop and question you if you are acting suspicious.</p>
<p>The Feds are being stupid too. Instead of arresting him in the theatre and making a fuss (and disturbing everyone in the theatre), they could have just waited until the movie has ended and arrested him outside, where they could have the opportunity to identify themselves and ask for his cooperation instead of manhandling him.</p>

Just because they movie industry can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t adapt and work with it&#8217;s consumer base doesn&#8217;t mean that everyone should change to fit is requirements. The industry is the one that needs to change to match its audience.

He was not at all breaking the law, so the way they treated him was completely uncalled for. However they would have been totally justified in pulling him out of the theater to politely ask him about the camera on his face, rather than harassing him for however long they did. Whether or not you agree with the laws they do still exist, no matter how dated they may be.</p>

Put to death? Not unless they wrongfully murdered someone. But if I were to harass someone the same way a fed/cop does now-a-days I would be arrested/sued and they should be too. But not all of them are bad, there are still officers and agents out there who sincerely want to protect their community. But &#8220;Cop obeys the law, while protecting everyones rights&#8221; isnt as great of a headline as &#8220;Cop pepper sprays protesters&#8221;. </p>
<p>Just my two cents. Im still all for bringing down this scumbag government, they stopped representing the people a very long time ago.</p>

<p>But I still wouldn&#8217;t advise people to go to the movies with a camera strapped to their face. Its just asking for unwanted attention. And again, I dont think the victim was deserving of the treatment he reportedly received and I frankly wouldnt care if this guy was trying to pirate the movie either. My point is, if you walk into a theater with a camera on your face you should not be surprised that people investigate the situation. Just like you would be observed carefully for taking a backpack into a store with a sign posted to not have a backpack in the store. </p>

Look at something as innocent as a  segway. Before the first one was even sold lawmakers passed laws restricting where segways could be used. Cellphones had all kinds of people up in arms at gyms and resulting in banned use of Cellphones in locker roons. I see people using their phones every time I&#8217;m at the gym and nobody is freaking out. </p>

I would say 50% are skull busters, 40% are paycheck cops and 10% are good cops. Oh and the best part is these numbers change by how long they are a cop! The longer they are on the job the more they shift to paycheck cops and the rookies tend to be head busters. This is all scientific of course, lol.</p>

DirectionsWrite a review<br />
Address: 275 Easton Town Center, Columbus, OH 43219<br />
Phone:(614) 428-5716</p>
<p>I talked to Stephany Mack who said that she didn’t know what Google Glass was then she talked to her manager who told her to tell me that she had no comment on the story. I then asked if it was OK if I can go to the theater with my google Glass and if i could wear them she said she had no comment. I told her that I was not asking for a comment on the story. I simply wanted to know if it was ok to wear my google glass while watching a movie. She reference me to a corporate number. So it appears that they are not a fan of Google Glass at the Easton Town Center 30. Thanks for your help Abby !</p>

SUE them and take large sums of cash from the RIAA for felony assault and battery. I suggest people obtain a cop of the constitution, and KNOW a little about law, and also understand that NOBODY can simply arrest and then assault you simply for &#8216;alleged&#8217; violations, a business is NOT empowered to play cop, if you are grabbed, that action becomes an assault, and if more forces is used, it becomes battery, and if they detain you against your will, it becomes unlawful imprisonment. BIG money comes from big business, not to mention the BAD PR they gain from playing GESTAPO AGENT.</p>

<p>&#8220;NSA surveillance does little to prevent terrorism, says think-tank report&#8221;: &#8220;there was only one case out of the 225 that was initiated by NSA evidence. The case involved a cab driver named Basaaly Moalin who was convicted of sending money to Somalian terrorist groups. While successful, the case did not involve any direct threat of attack&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;blank media tax or levy&#8221; = pure robbery</p>
<p>So my conclusion:</p>
<p>1) I won&#8217;t buy any song or movie or visit a cinema (I&#8217;ve already paid for that see &#8220;blank media tax or levy&#8221;)<br />
2) I will download movies and music forever<br />
3) I will spend more money for apps because I like them</p>
<p>wake up, keep the facts and don&#8217;t listen to the puppet called Obama</p>

<p>Let me break it down for you: With a cell phone, anyone can tell you&#8217;re recording. You&#8217;ve got to take it out of your pocket, point it at the screen, and have at it. With Glass? No such barrier. Its almost completely transparent to anyone that it is recording. </p>
<p>Try walking into a movie theater and pointing a camera of ANY sort at the screen &#8211; even in a powered-off state &#8211; and see what happens.</p>

Ok, I guess we are going to debate at the toddler level.</p>
<p>Let me break it down for you: no matter what the RIAA would like you to believe, piracy != murder. Glass cannot be used for mass murder as a gun can.</p>
<p>The response by the law enforcement agencies seems more akin to something you might have expected in communist USSR than in the land of the free and the home of the brave. It could all have been avoided had the officers taken the time to check to see if they were correct in their suspicions rather than assume they were and harass the individual involved for 4 hours.</p>

<p>I walk into a movie theater and right after the movie starts, I move to the back row and take out my GoPro camera, put it on a tripod, turn it on, and sit back to watch the movie. Now, I&#8217;ve not hit record &#8211; its just sitting there pointed at the screen. </p>
<p>I would not be surprised one iota if someone from the theatre, or the FBI, came in there and put their hands on my property. Were the GoPro attached to my head, I would expect there to be all sorts of hands all over my face. For all they know, I am recording, and they are protecting their intellectual property and stopping a crime in progress. </p>
<p>As I stated above, the cops could have acted with a bit more discretion &#8211; but for all they know a crime was being committed and they acted as such. In the case of anything that records, its rule number 1: assume it is on and broadcasting at all times. This is the exact same rule when speaking about firearms (assume they&#8217;re always loaded), so the analogy is totally sound, even if it appears to run afoul of comprehension around here. </p>
<p>Glass is a camera. It is at the very core of what it does. The fact that these were prescription glasses is secondary to the nature of the device. They were made to record, upload, download, and meld tech and the real world. To argue anything otherwise is folly.</p>

Secondary uses include video/photo but they are not the primary use case. It would be just as simple to have a phone in my shirt pocket over my heart and have it recording from my breast pocket which would be directed right at the screen and almost impossible to tell it was recording(No light on the front unlike Google glass that has a red dot on the front so you know when it is recording)</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-788934" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>In the case of a crime &#8211; the first step is to stop the crime from continuing. If I am beating someone, the police are going to stop me from beating that person in whatever manner they deem acceptable. If I am vandalizing someone&#8217;s property, they are going to stop me from continuing to vandalize and remove the spray paint from my hands. If I am pointing a gun at someone, they are going to remove the threat in whatever manner in which they choose &#8211; in the fastest and cleanest way possible. </p>
<p>The threat was the camera. The camera was pointed at the protected property, so the camera was swiftly and efficiently removed. If it WAS recording, every second it was allowed to remain in service was another second of breaking the law, and the police are not in the business of allowing law-breaking to continue. </p>
<p>The flaw in your argument is one that is at the very crux of Glass &#8211; it&#8217;s worn. Were it up on a tripod, they would have simply snatched up the tripod immediately and taken it, and the owner, away for questioning. The assumption is made from the outset that the camera is recording simply because its existence in that environment is against policy, the rules, and/or the law.</p>

The urgency isn&#8217;t there. And even when they got him outside, a quick check would show that there was no wrong doing.</p>

<p>Wrong. First step is to decide what action to take appropriate to the situation  &#8211; IE you would not shoot at an armed robber holding up a store if there were people standing behind the robber. First step is NOT to stop the crime, but to take appropriate action weighing all relevant factors.</p>
<p>Similar to a robbery, you would not decide to draw your weapon or physically tackle someone who you *suspected* was shoplifting &#8211; first thing to do would be to ask the person to come with you (not smack an item out of their hands that you *think* they were about to steal).</p>

<p>The problem is that you are unable to see that the two instances are exactly equal.  Perhaps you are too young to remember back in the &#8217;80&#8242;s, when movie theaters were searching people for cameras.  And yet, they have stopped now.  Why is that, do you think?</p>
<p>Let me break it down for you, any idiot who takes a minute with Google can figure out how to hide recording with a cell phone.   It is dead easy to make it look like a cell phone is &#8220;off&#8221; when it is not. </p>
<p>Try walking into any movie theater with a cell phone, looking like it is powered off, held in a position to see the screen.  What happens?  Nothing.  It&#8217;s &#8220;just a cell phone&#8221; and no different from Google Glass.</p>

<p>Your arguments have all been addressed elsewhere in this thread, with the exception of searching for cameras. The reason they have stopped is because the prevalence of cell phones. That&#8217;s it. They know that everyone in the room has a camera, so they&#8217;ve shifted enforcement to eliminating those that are an active threat. </p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re mistaken in your assumption that you&#8217;d be left alone if you had a cell phone pointed at a screen for any length of time. Here in ATL, they walk the aisles a few times during a movie looking for just that. </p>

<p>Bad analogy, Adam is right. Pointing a gun, loaded or not, at someone where you do not have a VERY good reason for doing so is a felony.</p>
<p>Pointing cameras or recording devices which are turned off breaks no laws different than having the device on your person.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>In one case, (camera) it makes no difference where it is pointed (and in some cases only makes a difference if it is actually recording) &#8211; in the other case (gun) makes a big difference whether it is holstered/concealed or pointing at someone &#8211; still may be illegal to have it on your person BUT a completely different charge if you are pointing it at someone w/o cause.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-788994" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Again &#8211; let&#8217;s entertain the gun analogy. Now, for arguments sake &#8211; imagine that it is legal to point a gun at someone, and the crime only happens when the trigger is pulled without legal reason to do so.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re pointing a gun at someone and a cop rolls up, are they going to know if the gun is loaded? If it isn&#8217;t, the gun is totally and completely harmless. Its just a hunk of metal with no capacity for harm other than being thrown really hard. </p>
<p>The cop isn&#8217;t going to be able to tell. They&#8217;re going to assume its loaded. Asking you if its loaded, and taking your word for it if you say it isn&#8217;t, is a quick way to become a dead cop. </p>
<p>Same thing with a voice-activated camera pointed at the screen. They have no way of knowing if its broadcasting or not, so they assume it is since that assumption has greater capacity to preserve the copyright. Just as the assumption that the gun is loaded has the greater capacity to save someone&#8217;s life. </p>
<p>Breaking copyright law down to its most basic elements, the only things that are legally permitted to take-in the film are your eyeballs and your earnubs. In my local AMC, they will remove you from the theater for having a camera. Cameras are expressly forbidden and this is plainly stated on signs throughout the lobby. Anything that has the mere capacity to take the audio or video beyond the walls of that room without permission is a legitimate threat to copyright. </p>
<p>Yes, this includes cell phones, but if they are concealed, the theaters give you a pass.</p>

<p>Neither statement is true, because both items are inanimate objects without the capacity in and of themselves to do anything without the input of an outside force. In other words, the Google Glass needs someone to activate its recording function, and the gun needs one to decide to orient his hand in such a way so that it is pointed at someone or something with the intent to cause harm, loss, or alarm. </p>
<p>Oh, and if pointing Google Glass at a movie screen is reason enough to assume criminal activity, so is facing someone within a range of ten feet or less. After all, if your mouth is pointed at me, how am I to know that you won&#8217;t spit upon me? FYI, prior restaint isn&#8217;t allowed in the U.S. yet, but unfortunately, due to the ignorance of people like you, it may be here soon.</p>

<p>The camera &#8211; any camera &#8211; is a legitimate threat, as well as already being afoul of the theatre&#8217;s policy. I don&#8217;t understand why this is such a hard concept for people to grasp. </p>
<p>The difference between your &#8220;10 feet&#8221; analogy and protecting a copyright, is that I can easily turn around and walk away if I feel threatened. KEEP following me, and I will feel threatened, and that constitutes assault, at which time &#8211; I can respond in a self-defensive manner. The movie can do no such thing. It can&#8217;t get away &#8211; so it is a locked-in victim (and remember, corporate entities are now people, so some of those doctrines are being applied to corporate property as well..) and as such, the law has an onus to defend it.</p>

I&#8217;ve done so elsewhere in this thread, but I will cut/paste here with some mild editing&#8230;</p>
<p>In the case of a crime &#8211; the first step is to stop the crime from continuing. If I am beating someone, the police are going to stop me from beating that person in whatever manner they deem acceptable. If I am vandalizing someone&#8217;s property, they are going to stop me from continuing to vandalize and remove the spray paint from my hands. If I am pointing a gun at someone, they are going to remove the threat in whatever manner in which they choose &#8211; in the fastest and cleanest way possible.</p>
<p>The threat was the camera, and the victim was the movie. The camera was pointed at the protected property, so the camera was swiftly and efficiently removed. If it WAS recording, every second it was allowed to remain in service was another second of breaking the law, and the police are not in the business of allowing law-breaking to continue. They HAD to act in a manner in which the camera was live since there simply was no way to tell otherwise, and when the ability of the threat can&#8217;t be determined, they must &#8211; not should &#8211; act as if the threat is &#8216;live&#8217;.</p>
<p>Were it a camera up on a tripod, they would have simply snatched up the tripod immediately and taken it, and the owner, away for questioning. The assumption is made from the outset that the camera is recording, much like the assumption that a gun is always loaded.</p>
<p>Just like a gun &#8211; the cop has NO way of telling if it is loaded (broadcasting) or even a toy. They have to assume that its real, and its a threat.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to be treated like a criminal, stop doing crap that looks illegal. Were I to walk around a mall parking lot holding a slim jim, a car stereo, and a ball-peen hammer, should I be surprised when the police respond in-kind?</p>

<p>Assumptions get people in trouble.  If you can confirm he was recording or he was in the act of committing a crime, then sure, do what you must.  However, merely having Glass is not enough to warrant your constitutionally protected rights from being figuratively raped.  Just like having a gun doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re about to commit a crime or warrant police stopping you.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re either being willfully obtuse, or just incapable of seeing that the mere act of having a camera pointed at a movie is a legitimate threat. In your pocket? Nope. Cell phone to your ear? Nope. On your face, pointed at the screen, capable of streaming directly to the web with a whispered command or a nondescript touch to the frame?</p>
<p>Absolutely. </p>
<p>Again, in cases where no determination can be made as to the severity of the threat, the assumption is made that the threat is active. Like it or not, its one of the tenants of law enforcement.</p>

<p>No, it&#8217;s not.  Having a camera pointed at a movie whilst recording, that is a legitimate threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;in cases where no determination can be made as to the severity of the threat, the assumption is made that the threat is active.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s not.  Just having something doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re breaking the law.  If I am safely open carrying a rifle in Texas, the cops have zero authority to stop and detain me.  It doesn&#8217;t matter if a rifle has the potential to be a threat, unless I am using it in an unlawful manner, then it&#8217;s business as usual.</p>
<p>We aren&#8217;t in Minority Report yet, and hopefully people will not forget that.  Deal with me after I commit a crime, not before, and don&#8217;t assume without credible evidence.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure how else I can explain this. Look at it this way &#8211; in our world, people kill people with guns. The mere act of pointing a gun at someone is a crime due to its capacity to do immediate and irreparable harm. Were you to point a gun at someone, loaded or unloaded &#8211; the officers are going to act as if it is loaded.</p>
<p>To a copyright, anything that can record and transmit audio and video kills the copyright. While it isn&#8217;t illegal (yet) to point a camera at the screen, its definitely inviting trouble from management and/or the law. Were you to point a camera at a movie &#8211; off or on &#8211; the police are going to act as if it is on. Either by standing in front of it, pointing it away from the screen, or simply removing it (and you) from the theater.</p>
<p>Another thing you are forgetting, in nearly every movie theater in the US, simply having a camera is against the rules and they can bounce you for it. Sure, they give you a pass on the cell phone, but try it with anything else. Walk up to a box office with a GoPro in your hand and see what happens.</p>

<p>That statement is why my argument holds true.  Being treated as a criminal for doing nothing illegal can never be the norm.</p>
<p>Obviously Glass is having its growing pains on what is and isn&#8217;t allowed (as we saw with the lady pulled over in her car).  I do suspect that movie theaters will prohibit Glass from being in the theater much like the GoPro you mentioned.  However, that will probably not hold true if that Glass has a prescription lens (much like Seeing Eye Dogs being allowed where other dogs are disallowed.)</p>
<p>This has been a good debate though.</p>

Comparing a camera to a weapon is simply illogical. The movie isnt being &#8220;harmed&#8221; while being recorded, so there is no reason to do anything except a polite whisper of, &#8220;Sir, could you please step outside of the theater and answer some questions.&#8221; If for any reason, so they don&#8217;t annoy the other movie goers.&#8221; Or, how about the theater management approaching the Google Glass wearer before the movie starts?  This sounds more like an &#8220;undercover&#8221; idiot with a hard-on for thinking he actually caught somebody breaking the law and some bored DHS agents.</p>
<p>Additionally, regarding federal agents being duty bound to stop a crime as it&#8217;s being committed, have you read the details of the Fast and Furious scandal? There was a whole lot of crime(with actual firearms) going on that federal agents were aware of and they were doing nothing to stop it while it was happening. </p>

If or when you do, how would you react if cops came running in while you were shopping at Target with her, ripped her purse away, and detained her for questioning for three hours?

Somehow I don&#8217;t think you would have the same view you have now if that happened. </p>

Why does the cell phone analogy keep popping up? One lives in your hand or your pocket, and the operator has to jump through many hoops to get it to record, AND re-orient the device to point at the subject of the recording, and the other is there, ready to go, and can stream live to a hangout with a simple touch or whispered word?</p>
<p>One must simply reach up and touch the side of the device, or stream directly to the web where it can easily be recorded. Its there, ready to go, in a fully operational state. So yes, they were wise to act as if this was a legitimate threat to copyright.</p>
<p>The phone is a threat to copyright only after certain parameters have been met. Parameters that are easily and efficiently decoded by anyone viewing the operator. Google Glass? Not so much&#8230;</p>

I could easily clip it to the corner of my seat (or to an empty seat in my side if the theater is not full). Nobody would notice, and it&#8217;s perfectly stable for much better capture, different from glasses unless you are a professional statue-man. And of course, a high-end smartphone has the camera quality, resolution and memory necessary to make a decent recording of a full-length movie; much different from Glass which has a lower-quality camera, max 720p, burns a whole battery charge in 30min of video capture. Of course future versions of Glass will improve these specs, but it will always be inferior for that task than a good smartphone, not to mention a dedicated mini-camera, it doesn&#8217;t even take a special &#8220;spy camera&#8221; like others suggested.</p>
<p>I fully understand people concerned with Glass users in &#8220;semi-public&#8221; places where some privacy is expected and necessary (the local strip club&#8230;), but not in theaters for stealing copyrighted material, this is just plain stupidity.</p>

He&#8217;s not sure what agency people were from?  I get he may have been shaken/scared at first but at some point during 3 hours of questioning when you know you are innocent  I would think most people would start asking for ID and requesting an attorney.  The guy from the &#8220;movie association&#8221; was named Bob Hope?  He claims he has physical evidence, the 4 movie passes they gave him.  How about a picture of those?</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-788957" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Ironically, most movie piracy at theaters happens by theater employees hooking up hardware to one of the projectionist output ports on the other end of some legitimate HDCP capable electronics interfaced with a fake flat panel LVDS device emulator to just pull the data off digitally, and then it&#8217;s compared with multiple other copies of the same content to strip out any per-theater watermarking.  Most of this happens in foreign theaters after foreign release of the films.</p>
<p>Google Glass is good for at most about 45 minutes worth of recording at 720p, and is about as watchable without software reframing to a lower pixel resolution as The Blair Witch Project.  So even a crappy recording of the 1:45 Jack Ryan film would require 3 Glass wearers, and the audio quality would suck, and the video watermarking artifacts would clearly identify both the theater and showtime.</p>
<p>BTW, most digital copy piracy actually happens by dumpster diving the prerelease copies of the DVDs sent to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in order to get their votes for the Oscars, which is why most piracy occurs prior to the Oscars.  These are also now watermarked, so without multiple samples, it&#8217;s hard to strip the watermarking, and the members have recently been more careful about destroying them before they end up in the dumpster.</p>
<p>Most actual DVD piracy happens in the Chinese factories producing the DVDs, where they run what&#8217;s called a &#8220;third shift&#8221;.  The do an 8 hour production run for the studio, then they do another 8 hour production run for the studio, then they do another 8 hour production run (not for the studio), and sell the results.  The &#8220;third shift&#8221; happens in electronics and other manufacturing as well, which is why companies like Apple generally have a choke-hold on the availability of at least 5 or six device components in their supply chain, so it&#8217;s impossible to use their designs for the counterfeits &#8211; the components necessary just aren&#8217;t there.</p>

The theater missed a few steps and should have either stopped the man from entering the theater with them on or asked him to step outside to explain before the movie started.

There&#8217;s a fine line between asserting your rights, and shooting yourself in the foot. Simply saying &#8220;lawyer&#8221; and shutting up is shooting yourself in the foot. You will likely have cuffs slapped on you and sit in a cell until you go in front of a judge. Depending on the severity of the charge that can have life changing consequences, even if charges are dropped. </p>
<p>Claiming assault is&#8230; amusing. Search without cause is also amusing. False arrest? was he arrested or simply detained? Kidnapping? You have got to be out of your mind. Sue? over what?</p>

His possessions were illegally seized without warrant or reasonable evidence that something illegal was going on. Seizure of private property without a warrant requires probable cause, which it doesn&#8217;t seem that they didn&#8217;t had. First, set aside the Google glass, they took his wallet and his two phones which were in his pocket and clearly not in use at the time they observed him. As they were not objects that were observed in any capacity or capability to be doing anything illegal and since he had not been placed under arrest they had no right to take and withhold these items from him. This is ILLEGAL. </p>
<p>Regarding the Google Glass, as he noted, if it were recording, a light would have indicated it was recording. All the agents had to do was observe him for all of five seconds to ascertain if the device was on or not. It is pretty clear that they lacked even any basic understanding about Google Glass. They had no idea how to recognize if it was in operation (as evidenced by their not knowing how to recognize if it was powered on/recording or not). They had no clue as it&#8217;s dollar value (as evidenced by their handling of it before and then after they found out what it cost). They made an uneducated leap/conclusion about his activities, leading to unwarranted seizure of private property and then holding him and his wife against their will for several hours without being charged or given their Miranda warning.</p>
<p>I think you very much could make an argument for kidnapping against both the agents and the theater as he was held against his will for several hours without being charged or read his rights as well as illegal search and seizure.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly worth his contacting a lawyer or the ACLU. This type of rampant jack-booted thuggery needs to be publicly, and legally opposed at every turn. The police and other agencies were formed first and foremost to protect the citizenry and uphold the law, but more and more they are made to serve the bastions of corporate power and greed. Silence is acquiescence.</p>

He has a pair of regular glasses at home, he could have thought to bring those to the theater. Agents are not there to know every detail about every gadget either.

<p>Of course if the comportement of agents here is described accurately they did act like douchebags.</p>

Pretty much every cell phone you can buy today is capable of taking pictures and/or recording.    Your argument doesn&#8217;t hold water.   </p>
<p>If theaters don&#8217;t want Google Glass coming in, they need to put up a sign specifically saying so and make sure that buying a ticket means you agree to the terms of theater.</p>

Personally, I&#8217;m not having my rights trampled.  This guy was sitting in a theater, minding his own business, hurting nobody, and a federal agent came in <i>and assaulted him!</i>  Go find a cop wearing classes and snatch them off his face.  You&#8217;ll get your ass shot.  Why?  <i>It&#8217;s assault!</i></p>
<p>Initiation of physical contact construed as use of force is assault.  Arrest means you&#8217;re being detained under suspicion, you are not free to go.  Kidnapping is holding a person against their will without cause.  All three happened, and he has an airtight suit.</p>
